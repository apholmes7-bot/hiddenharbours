# Water Rendering — the layered URP water shader (recipe + the shipped first pass)

> **Status: FIRST PASS SHIPPED (greybox-real) + PAINTED-TEXTURE SLOTS.** The layered shader now exists
> as a **text URP 2D HLSL/ShaderLab shader** (NOT a Shader Graph — authored as text so it builds
> headless), wired to the deterministic sim. The §0 "Applying the shader" note below covers what shipped
> and how to use it; §2–§5 remain the layer-by-layer recipe (now describing the built layers). Colours /
> speeds / foam / thresholds are all Inspector tunables on the material — the owner art-directs the LOOK
> next; this is a solid first pass, not final polish. **The shader also accepts optional owner-painted
> TEXTURES (§10)** that blend with / override the matching procedural layer when assigned, and fall back
> to the procedural look when empty — so art-pipeline can hand-paint foam, caustics, ripple, sparkle, the
> depth-colour ramp, and whitecaps without touching the shader. Decision of record:

>
> The first pass ships three reusable pieces:
>
> | Asset | Path | What it is |
> |---|---|---|
> | **Shader** | `Assets/_Project/Art/Shaders/HiddenHarboursWater.shader` | the custom URP 2D unlit `HiddenHarbours/Water` shader — all five layers, every colour/speed/threshold a material property |
> | **Material** | `Assets/_Project/Art/Materials/Water.mat` | the tunable instance the owner art-directs (the single place to change the look) |
> | **Runtime** | `Assets/_Project/Code/Art/WaterSurface.cs` (`HiddenHarbours.Art`) | the SIM→shader bridge MonoBehaviour |

> **To put live water in ANY scene (including the hand-painted cove):**
> 1. On the scene's **water plane** SpriteRenderer (or a quad), set its **Material** to `Water.mat`.
>    The shader ignores the sprite texture — it draws everything procedurally from world position — so
>    any sea sprite/quad works as the canvas.
> 2. Add the **`WaterSurface`** component to the same GameObject. Set **Height world center / size** to
>    the world rectangle the water covers, so the baked seabed depth map lines up with that region's
>    `TidalTerrain`. Leave the rest at defaults.
> 3. Press Play. `WaterSurface` reads `GameServices.Environment` + `GameServices.TidalTerrain` and feeds
>    the surface every throttled tick — water flows with the current, roughens in wind, and its
>    shoreline/foam track the tide. With no `TidalTerrain` wired the plane reads as uniform deep water
>    (no false shoreline) — safe in any region.
> 4. **Tune the look** on `Water.mat` in the Inspector: depth colours/bands, surface noise/flow, foam
>    width/softness, specular amount/sharpness/light-dir, caustic amount/scale/depth, the pixel grid
>    (`Pixels Per Unit`, default 32), the **anti-tiling** lever (`Untile Strength`, default 0.6 — raise

>    0.3 m, `Swash Speed` 0.5, `Swash Wavelength` 1.2, `Swash Along-Shore Vary` 0.35 — the fast in/out

>    editing, no code.

## 1. North star (what this shader is for)

Water is a **first-class P1 system** ("The Sea Has Moods"), not a backdrop
([`art-and-audio-bible.md`](art-and-audio-bible.md) §3.5). This shader delivers the hero water look:
shallow→deep colour, living surface, foam that hugs the **moving** tide waterline, sun glint, and
caustic shimmer in the shallows — all while reading as **PPU=32 pixel art** (§3.1), and all driven by
the **same height-map + tide data the gameplay reads**, so what the player *sees* and what the physics
*does* are one truth (the P1 integrity rule, §2.2).

Two rules dominate every layer below:

1. **Pixelize world coords in every layer** (§3). The surface must read as pixel art, not smooth 3D.
2. **Depth comes from the shared height map** (§4): `depth = waterLevel − terrainHeight`, the same
   arithmetic as `Core.TidalExposure.WaterDepth` and the same `IEnvironmentService.WaterLevelAt` the
   walkability sim uses (ADR 0009 / #59).

---

## 2. The layer stack (foundation → polish)

Build in this order; each layer is a Shader Graph **subgraph** (mirroring the tutorial's structure),
composited into a **main water shader**. Earlier layers are the foundation later ones mask against.

| # | Layer / subgraph | Input | Produces | Pillar |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Depth gradient** (base) | height map → `depth` | shallow→deep base colour ramp | P1 (reads as water) |
| 2 | **Surface distortion** | scrolling perlin/value-noise × time | swell, living surface; UV warp for later layers | P1 (moods) |
| 3 | **Sea-foam fringe** | foam texture, masked by depth≈0 band | foam hugging the moving waterline | P1/P5 (tide tell, hazard edge) |
| 4 | **Specular** | sun/sky dir + surface | glint highlights on the surface | P1 (light/mood) |
| 5 | **Caustics** | perlin × time, depth-gated to shallows | rippling light over the visible seabed | P1/P5 (read the shallows) |

> Composite order is bottom-up: **depth gradient → (distort surface) → specular over surface → foam at
> the edge band → caustics gated to the shallow depth range.** The distortion subgraph's output UV/offset
> is reused to animate foam, specular and caustics so they all "swim" with the same surface.

---

## 3. Pixel-art fidelity (MANDATORY in every layer)

Every layer/subgraph **pixelizes world coordinates** before sampling noise/textures, so the result
snaps to the PPU=32 grid and reads as pixel art rather than smooth 3D water. The node pattern:

```
World Position  ──► Multiply (× PPU, e.g. 32)  ──► Floor  ──► Divide (÷ PPU)  ──► pixelized coord
```

- Apply this to the coords feeding **noise** (surface, caustics), **foam UV/mask**, and **specular** —
  not just the base colour. A layer that samples smooth coords will betray the pixel look.
- `PPU` is a shader property (default 32, matching §3.1), **not** a hard-coded literal (CLAUDE.md
  rule 6) — so art-pipeline can experiment without editing the graph, and a future zoom band can pass
  an effective PPU.
- The depth ramp itself can be **posterized** (quantized to N colour bands) to reinforce the pixel
  feel and read as the master palette's discrete water ramp (§4).

This rule is the difference between "URP water that happens to be in our game" and "our water." It is
non-negotiable and holds the LOCKED §2 (one perspective) / §3 (one scale, PPU) rules.

---

## 4. The height-map unification (the key architecture)

A single **height map** — per-region **terrain elevation in metres above chart datum** — is the shared
source of truth for **three** consumers, all reading the *same* number:

1. **This shader** — depth gradient (layer 1) and foam band (layer 3).
2. **Tide walkability** — `Core.TidalExposure.IsExposed(WaterLevelAt(t), terrainElevation)` and
   `IEnvironmentService.WaterLevelAt(t)` (ADR 0009 / #59); the on-foot walkability sim.
3. **Boat-cross** — "deep enough = passable": boat draught vs `WaterDepth` (boats doc owns the
   consequence).

The one equation, everywhere:

```
depth = waterLevel − terrainHeight        // metres; <= 0 means dry / exposed
        └─ WaterLevelAt(t) ─┘  └─ height map sample ─┘
```

- `waterLevel` = `IEnvironmentService.WaterLevelAt(gameTime)` — deterministic, recomputed from
  `(worldSeed, gameTime)`, **never saved** (CLAUDE.md rule 5; ADR 0009). The shader receives it as a
  **material float**, set on tide change / the slow tick — **not** recomputed per frame.
- `terrainHeight` = the authored height-map value at the position (read-only authored content).
- This generalizes the canon **seabed-elevation / bathymetry heightfield** — already named the *single
  source of truth* for "passable / walkable / hazard" in
  [`time-tides-weather.md`](time-tides-weather.md) §3.5 — to **all** terrain (land above datum
  included). It resolves the **rendering half** of that doc's **OQ1** (mapping tide→visual cues).

**The St Peters sandbar is just a low ridge in the height map.** As the deterministic tide falls, the
ridge's `depth` crosses zero; the shader's foam band (layer 3) sweeps across it *and* the same
zero-crossing makes it walkable (`IsExposed`). Render and sim cannot disagree — they read one map. The
Drownded Lands flats and Sunkers tide-pools work the same way.

> **Why this matters:** decoupling a "visual seabed" from a "physics seabed" is exactly the drift ADR
> 0009 exists to prevent. One height map, three consumers, one equation.

## 5. Subgraph breakdown (the build recipe)

Each subgraph below lists *intent → inputs → method → pixelize point → tunables*. Tunables are
shader/material properties or Def values (rule 6), owned by art-pipeline.

### 5.1 Depth gradient (base) — layer 1

- **Intent:** the water reads shallow→deep; the base every other layer sits on.
- **Inputs:** height map sample (`terrainHeight`), `WaterLevelAt(t)` (material float) → `depth`.
- **Method:** `depth = waterLevel − terrainHeight`; remap `depth` over a shallow→deep **colour ramp**
  (the §4 master palette water ramp: pale shallow teal → deepwater navy `#16242E`). Optionally
  **posterize** to N bands for the pixel read. `depth <= 0` → fully transparent / hands off to terrain
  (the tile/Rule-Tile ground shows through; the shader does not draw land).
- **Pixelize:** posterize the ramp; pixelize the position used for any depth-edge softening.
- **Tunables:** ramp gradient + stops, band count, shallow/deep depth thresholds.

### 5.2 Surface distortion — layer 2

- **Intent:** a living surface — gentle swell, sea-state-driven amplitude (glassy → white-capped).
- **Inputs:** pixelized world coords, `time`, sea-state amplitude (from
  [`time-tides-weather.md`](time-tides-weather.md) weather/sea-state; a material float).
- **Method:** scrolling **perlin / value-noise** sampled at `(pixelizedCoord + time·scrollDir)`;
  output a small UV offset / normal-ish perturbation reused by foam, specular and caustics so they all
  swim together. Two octaves at different scroll speeds reads richer than one. **Shipped: now three
  syncopated octaves on distinct (direction, rate) — current swell along `_FlowDir`, a wind-driven chop
  along `_WindDir`, and a slow perpendicular cross-swell — so the surface follows the wind and stops
  reading as one marching grid (§5.7).**
- **Pixelize:** pixelize the noise sample coords (§3) so swell snaps to the grid.
- **Tunables:** noise scale, scroll direction + speed (**wind direction now wired — §5.7**), amplitude vs
  sea-state, octave mix (the per-octave syncopation weights, §5.7).

### 5.3 Sea-foam fringe — layer 3

- **Intent:** foam that **hugs the moving waterline**, the headline tide tell (P1) and hazard edge
  around rocks/hulls (P5) — not a fixed painted edge.
- **Inputs:** `depth` (from 5.1), a **foam texture**, the layer-2 distortion offset.
- **Method:** build an **edge mask** from a **blurred-edge / depth≈0 band** — `smoothstep` of `depth`
  across a thin band around zero (`0 → foamWidth` metres), so the band sits exactly where the tide
  meets the seabed *now*. Multiply the foam texture (scrolled by the layer-2 offset so it churns) by
  the mask. Because the mask is a function of `depth`, the foam **follows `WaterLevel`** every tide
  with zero re-authoring — the live waterline lives **here, in the shader**, not in tiles (ADR 0010
  decision (4)).
- **Pixelize:** pixelize the foam-texture UV and the band so the fringe reads as crisp pixel foam.
- **Tunables:** foam band width (metres of depth), edge softness, foam texture + tint, churn speed.

### 5.4 Specular — layer 4

- **Intent:** sun/sky glint on the surface; night water dark with sparse highlights; fog flattens it
  (art-bible §3.5 "Reflections & light").
- **Inputs:** an **implied light direction** (the §3.5.1 single baked light dir, consistent with boats
  and shadows — *do not* invent a second sun), the layer-2 surface perturbation, sky/sun colour from
  the day-night grade (§6 lighting).
- **Method:** a cheap highlight where the perturbed surface faces the implied light; modulate
  intensity/colour by time-of-day + weather (calm glassy = sharp glint; gale/fog = scattered/greyed).
- **Pixelize:** pixelize/posterize the highlight so glints read as pixel sparkles, not smooth specular.
- **Tunables:** highlight sharpness, intensity vs sea-state/weather, sparkle density.

### 5.5 Caustics — layer 5

- **Intent:** rippling light over the **visible seabed** in the shallows — the shimmer that says "you
  can see the bottom here" (pairs with the depth sounder; P1/P5 "read the shallows").
- **Inputs:** pixelized coords, `time`, `depth` (for the shallow gate).
- **Method:** **perlin × time** distortion forming caustic ripple, **depth-gated** so it only appears
  where `depth` is within a shallow range (fades out into deep water). Composited additively over the
  depth gradient where the bottom would be visible.
- **Pixelize:** pixelize the perlin coords (§3).
- **Tunables:** caustic scale + speed, shallow depth range (fade in/out), intensity.

### 5.6 Anti-tiling + always-on beach swash (shipped upgrades)

Two fixes the owner asked for after seeing the painted-texture first pass live. Both are in
`HiddenHarboursWater.shader`; both expose every value as a material property (rule 6); both are
**visual-only** (no sim, no save — rule 5).

**(A) Anti-tiling of the painted slots — `_UntileStrength` (0..1, default 0.6, ON).** At a CALM
sea-state the painted **surface** tile's repeat grid reads as an obvious small square (it's hidden at
"Light"+ only because chop/flow motion masks it). The `UntileSampleW` helper breaks the grid two ways,
both dialed by `_UntileStrength`:
- **Domain warp** — the sample world-coord is nudged by the low-freq surface `ValueNoise` so straight
  tile seams bend before they're sampled (cheap, smooth).
- **IQ-style hash-untile** — per repeat-cell, the lookup is offset by a per-cell hash (`Hash22`) and two
  neighbouring offset variants are cross-faded by a smooth weight, so adjacent cells differ yet never
  show a seam (the [Inigo-Quilez "untile"](https://iquilezles.org/articles/texturerepetition/) trick,
  adapted to our point-sampled pixel grid).

It is applied to the four **scrolling** painted slots — `_SurfaceTex` (the primary fix), `_FoamTex`,
`_CausticTex`, `_SparkleTex` — and stays **pixel-art faithful**: the per-tile offset is added to the
**world** coord *before* `PaintUV` pixelizes, so the untiled lookup still snaps to the PPU grid and
remains point-sampled. `0` = the raw repeating grid; `1` = fully broken up. Cost: one extra noise eval
plus two extra texture taps per untiled slot only when `_UntileStrength > 0` — within the rule-7 budget.

**(B) Always-on beach swash — `_SwashAmplitude` (m, default 0.3), `_SwashSpeed` (default 0.5),
`_SwashWavelength` (default 1.2), `_SwashAlongShoreVary` (0..1, default 0.35).** Before this, the
**only** in/out shoreline motion was the slow deterministic tide. The swash adds a **fast, continuous,
cosmetic** waterline wash — "waves crashing in and out" — driven off `_Time` in the shader
(`BeachSwash`): a two-beat sine produces a signed **depth offset** (`±_SwashAmplitude` m) that advances
(run-up) and recedes (backwash) the wet edge.

- **The crest rolls SHOREWARD, not around the island (the rotation fix).** The original phase advanced
  along a **fixed world diagonal** (`(worldX+worldY)·_SwashScale`). On the round island's ring-shaped
  foam band a crest travelling in one compass direction sweeps *around* the ring's circumference — the
  owner saw the foam **rotate** around the island. Real run-up rolls **shoreward**, perpendicular to the
  local coast, everywhere at once. So the phase is now driven by the **shoreward coordinate**: the local
  visual `depth` (which decreases toward shore). A crest sits at constant total phase
  `θ = t·speed·2π + depth·_SwashWavelength`; holding `θ` as `t` grows forces `depth` to **shrink**, so
  each crest marches to ever-shallower water — **in** toward the beach — the same radial run-up at every
  point on the ring. The shore-normal comes from `ShoreDir()` (the baked-seabed height gradient, §11), so
  no fixed compass direction is involved. `_SwashWavelength` sets the shoreward wave spacing (crests per
  metre of depth); larger = tighter-packed run-up lines.
- **Along-shore desync, not a travelling wave.** To keep the wash from pulsing as one flat ring, a
  **small** value-noise offset (`_SwashAlongShoreVary`) sampled along the shore **tangent** (perpendicular
  to `ShoreDir`) breaks neighbouring stretches of coast slightly out of sync — organic, but it carries
  **no** single world direction, so it can never re-form a coherent wave circling the island. The
  dominant motion stays shoreward (in/out); this term is only a subtle desync. `0` = a perfectly
  in-phase ring; the default `0.35` reads natural.
- **Flat-seabed fallback.** Where `ShoreDir()` returns zero (open deep water / no height map) there is no
  shoreward axis, so the swash falls back to a **gentle time-only pulse** (no travelling term) — the wet
  edge still animates, and there is no fixed-direction sweep to circle anything.
- **Confined to the foam band (the P1 integrity rule).** The swash offset is multiplied by a band gate
  (`1 − smoothstep(0, foamWidth·2 + |amp|, depth)` — full at the wet edge, **zero** by the band reach)
  and applied **only** to a *local foam-only depth* (`foamDepth`). The real `depth` that drives
  `clip()`, the deep-water tint (`dt`), and the caustic gate is **never touched** — so deep water does
  not move and **the cosmetic wash cannot move the gameplay waterline** (it's foam *dressing* on top of
  the real depth read: saves nothing, drives no sim — rule 5). Set `_SwashAmplitude = 0` to disable.

The swash math has a pure-C# twin in `WaterSurface.cs` (`SwashOffset` + `SwashBandGate`) so the
oscillation, the amplitude bound, and **the band-confinement invariant** are unit-tested headless
(`Assets/Tests/EditMode/Art/ArtRenderingTests.cs`) without opening Unity — the twin feeds no sim and is
not pushed to the material; the shader owns the live wash. (The twin's `alongShore` phase parameter is
now a generic phase seed; the shoreward-phase rework lives in the shader — updating the C# twin's phase
formula to mirror it is a small gameplay-systems follow-up and does not affect the bounded-oscillation
contract the tests assert.)

> **Retired dial:** `_SwashScale` (the old fixed-diagonal along-shore scale) is replaced by
> `_SwashWavelength` + `_SwashAlongShoreVary`. Any `_SwashScale` value serialized in `Water.mat` / the
> Water Presets is now **inert** (Unity ignores a serialized property the shader no longer declares); the
> new dials pick up their Properties-block defaults until the owner tunes them.

### 5.7 Wind direction + syncopation + FBM variance (shipped upgrade)

The owner saw the surface "stay organized in a pattern" and "march one direction." The cause was a
shader/sim split: the sim's wind **already varies direction over time** (`WeatherModel.SampleWind` —
prevailing-wander + gust veer), but the shader **discarded** wind direction — it scrolled *every*
animated layer along `_FlowDir` (the tidal **current**, a fixed axis) and used wind only as the scalar
`_Roughness`. So no matter the weather the whole sea slid down one diagonal. This upgrade makes the
surface follow the **wind** (intensity **and** direction), adds multi-rate/multi-direction wave octaves
(syncopation), and adds organic low-frequency variance (FBM) that also scatters the specular sparkles.
All of it is **visual-only** — like the beach swash, it touches only `col.rgb` / the foam dressing and
**never** `depth`, `clip()`, the deep-tint, the caustic gate, or `_WaterLevel`; it drives no sim and
saves nothing (P1 integrity, CLAUDE.md rule 5). Every constant is a material property (rule 6), and
every new octave/field is **pixelized** like the rest (pixel-art faithful, §3). The new layers default
**ON at a modest strength** so the change is visible immediately yet fully dial-able on `Water.mat`.

**(A) Wind direction is now pushed to the shader — `_WindDir`.** `WaterSurface.cs` adds
`IdWindDir = Shader.PropertyToID("_WindDir")` and, in `PushUniforms` (right after the `_FlowDir`
set-vector), pushes `WindDirection(EnvironmentSample.WindVector)` — a new pure static helper mirroring
`FlowDirection`: it normalizes the wind vector (strength is dropped here — it still drives `_Roughness`
separately) and falls back to `Vector2.up` on near-zero wind (`sqrMagnitude < 1e-6`, NaN-safe), matching
the shader's `_WindDir` default `(0,1,0,0)`. A headless EditMode test
(`WindDirection_FollowsTheWind_NormalizesAndFallsBackOnSlackWind`) covers the normalization,
strength-independence, and slack-wind fallback (alongside the existing `FlowDirection`/`SwashOffset`
tests). The runtime push is throttled like every other uniform — no per-frame cost.

**(B) Wind-driven chop octave — `WindChop`.** A new 1–2-octave value-noise field scrolled along
`normalize(_WindDir.xy)` at its **own** rate `_WindChopSpeed` and scale `_WindChopScale` — a **separate
scroll from `_FlowDir`**. This is the layer that *follows the wind*. Folded into the surface mix weighted
by `_WindChop` (0..1). Pixelized like `SurfaceNoise`.

**(C) Syncopation — `SurfaceNoise` is now 3 octaves with distinct (direction, rate).** The old two-octave
`SurfaceNoise` (both along `_FlowDir`) becomes:
- **A** = the **current swell** along `_FlowDir` @ `_Flow` (the original look — the foundation);
- **B** = the **wind chop** along `_WindDir` @ `_WindChopSpeed` (weighted `_WindChop`);
- **C** = a **slow cross-swell** along a derived **perpendicular** axis (the 90°-rotation of the average
  of flow & wind) @ `_CrossSwellSpeed` with a big `_CrossSwellScale` — or an explicit `_CrossSwellDir`
  when set (its default `(0,0)` means "auto-perpendicular").

B and C are mixed by single, clear per-octave weights (no double-counting): octave B's effective weight
is `_WindChop × _Octave2Weight` (the headline wind knob × an octave-2 fine-tune), octave C's is
`_Octave3Weight`. The blend is normalized so the result stays ~0..1 regardless of the weights. Different
directions + rates break the single-direction read at **~no extra cost** — still pure value-noise, no
textures.

**(D) FBM low-frequency variance — `Fbm` + a tint and a sparkle gate.** A new `Fbm(p, octaves)` helper
(4 octaves of `ValueNoise`, lacunarity 2, gain 0.5, each pixelized) is sampled once per pixel at a **big**
scale `_FbmScale`, slowly drifting at `_FbmDriftSpeed`, giving broad slow patches. Its 0..1 value does two
things, **both `col.rgb`-only**:
- **(i) Tint patchwork** — near the base-colour step it lerps `col.rgb` toward `_FbmTint` (strength
  `_FbmStrength`) plus a gentle brightness wobble, so the sea breaks into broad slow patches instead of an
  even sheet.
- **(ii) Specular scatter** — the specular glint is multiplied by `smoothstep(_FbmGateLo, _FbmGateHi, fbm)`
  **before** it's added, so sparkles **cluster** in organic patches instead of an even posterized lattice.
  The hard `floor(glint*4+0.5)/4` posterize is replaced by a tunable band count `_SpecBands`.

**(E) A second domain-warp octave in `UntileSampleW`.** The anti-tiling domain warp now sums a low-freq
bend **and** a finer ripple octave (still dialed by the existing `_UntileStrength`, no new knob) so the
untiled painted slots read more organic. `_UntileStrength = 0` is unchanged (raw grid).

> **Property summary (all additive — none of the owner's existing tuned values changed):**
> *wind chop* — `_WindDir` (vec, sim-driven; default `(0,1)`), `_WindChop` (0.4), `_WindChopScale` (0.7),
> `_WindChopSpeed` (0.09). *syncopation* — `_CrossSwellDir` (vec, `(0,0)`=auto-perp), `_CrossSwellSpeed`
> (0.025), `_CrossSwellScale` (0.16), `_Octave2Weight` (0.35), `_Octave3Weight` (0.3). *FBM* — `_FbmScale`
> (0.05), `_FbmDriftSpeed` (0.012), `_FbmStrength` (0.18), `_FbmTint` (pale teal), `_FbmGateLo` (0.35),
> `_FbmGateHi` (0.7), `_SpecBands` (4). To calm the look back toward the old single-direction surface, set
> `_WindChop` / `_Octave2Weight` / `_Octave3Weight` / `_FbmStrength` to 0.

### 5.8 Cohesion pass — rolling ocean swell + wind-streaked foam + flow-with-body (shipped upgrade)

The §5.7 upgrade gave the surface organic small-scale variance, but the owner noted it read as a **field
of separate specks**, not **one large body** of water — and that the foam/whitecap layers were scrolling
on a diagonal **opposite** to the surface (`float2(-t*_Flow, t*_Flow)`). This **cohesion pass** adds three
coupled layers, all **visual-only** (col.rgb / foam dressing — never `depth`, `clip()`, the deep-tint
`dt`, the caustic gate, or `_WaterLevel`; drives no sim, saves nothing — P1 integrity, CLAUDE.md rule 5),
every constant a material property (rule 6), every new field **pixelized** (decision (2)), modest defaults
**ON** so the cohesion is visible yet fully dial-able. **Everything keys off the LIVE, time-wandering sim
directions** (`_WindDir` from `WeatherModel`, `_FlowDir` from PR #95's drifting current bearing — both
already pushed by `WaterSurface.cs`), so the whole body visibly **reorients as the weather shifts** — no
hardcoded angle (the P1 "sea has moods" integrity).

**(A) Rolling ocean swell — the keystone (`SwellField`).** ONE big, **long-wavelength** swell field over
worldXY: a low-frequency directional wave (a sine **along** the swell axis, broken up by a slow value-noise
so the bands aren't ruler-straight), scrolling **slowly** along that axis. Its 0..1 crest factor modulates
the **base-colour brightness** (crests lighter, troughs darker) so broad light/dark **bands roll across the
WHOLE surface** — the §5.7 small variance rides on top, and the sea reads as **one connected body**. The
swell **direction defaults to the (wandering) wind** (`SwellDir()` — wind generates swell), with an optional
`_OceanSwellDir` override (`(0,0)` = auto-from-`_WindDir`), so the bands reorient as the wind veers. The
same field is **reused** below (crest-gate the whitecaps, bias the specular) so foam, glint and brightness
all ride the **same** swell.

**(B) Wind-streaked foam (wind rows).** The open-water whitecap speckle is now **anisotropic** — sampled on
a coordinate **compressed perpendicular to `_WindDir`** (a wind-aligned basis: along-wind axis kept,
cross-wind axis multiplied by `_FoamStreakStretch`) so a round noise cell **elongates into a long thin
streak ALONG the wind** instead of isotropic speckle. The existing wind/roughness gating (the `_Roughness`
threshold + the deep-water `dt` gate) is unchanged.

The swell-direction and foam-drift **direction logic** has pure C# twins in `WaterSurface.cs`
(`SwellDirection`, `FoamDriftDirection`) — **not pushed** to the material (the shader derives the live
versions from the already-pushed `_WindDir`/`_FlowDir`; **no new uniform**), unit-tested headless
(`ArtRenderingTests.cs`) for the auto-from-wind default, the override-wins rule, the wind/current blend, and
the NaN-safe fallbacks — the determinism guard for the cohesion reorientation.

### 5.9 Living foam — an evolving field + a soft (metaball) threshold (shipped upgrade)

The owner saw the open-water whitecaps (and the foam-fringe churn) read as a **repeating pattern** whose
shapes **never change**: the foam was a **fixed-shape noise stamp that only TRANSLATED** across the surface
(one `ValueNoise` sample scrolled by `capDrift`/`foamDrift`), masked by a **hard `step()`**. A sliding stamp
+ a hard cut is a sliding repeat by construction. This pass makes the foam **EVOLVE, not just translate**:
patches **MERGE**, **SEPARATE**, and **CHANGE SHAPE** over time, and the residual painted-tile repeat is
killed. Like every prior addendum it is **visual-only** — it touches only `col.rgb` / `col.a` (the foam
blend) and **never** `depth`, `clip()`, the deep-tint, the caustic gate, or `_WaterLevel`; it drives no sim
and saves nothing (P1 integrity, CLAUDE.md rule 5). Every constant is a material property (rule 6) and every
new field is **pixelized** (decision (2)), defaults **ON at a modest strength**, fully dial-able on `Water.mat`.

**(A) The evolving FIELD (`EvolvingField`) — the field morphs in place.** A new pseudo-3D value-noise helper
replaces the single translating `ValueNoise` for both the whitecaps and the fringe churn. It is built by
**blending two time-offset `ValueNoise` samples of the SAME coord, where the mix itself animates** — as the
mix sweeps, a local maximum from one sample fades while a (differently-placed) maximum from the other rises,
so bright spots **appear, grow, drift, shrink and vanish**: the field MORPHS instead of sliding rigidly. Two
such "boil" pairs run half a step out of phase (a smoothed crossfade) so the morph is **continuous and
seamless** (no popping when a pair re-randomizes at a step boundary). The existing **wind+current drift**
(`FoamDriftDir()`, blended by `_FoamDriftWindVsCurrent`) is layered ON TOP — the foam still **travels with
the weather**; the in-place evolution is *added* to that drift, not a replacement. `_FoamEvolveSpeed` sets
the boil rate (0 = frozen shapes, just drift); `_FoamBlobScale` sets the blob size (smaller = bigger blobs).
Pure value-noise + pixelize, a few extra taps — within the rule-7 budget.

**(B) MERGE / SEPARATE via a SOFT THRESHOLD.** The foam mask is now
`smoothstep(_FoamThreshold − _FoamThresholdSoft, _FoamThreshold + _FoamThresholdSoft, field)` — **not** a hard
`step`. This soft band is the metaball mechanism: when two field maxima grow toward each other the **valley
between them rises** above `thr − soft` and the blobs **MERGE**; when the field **dips** below between them
they **SEPARATE**; and a maximum rising through / falling back across the band **fades a blob IN / OUT** — so
the foam reads as organic, connected, living patches rather than a binary speckle. The wind-roughness still
lowers the cap threshold (rougher ⇒ more sea above the threshold ⇒ more caps), the **swell-crest gate**
(`_FoamCrestGate`) still lifts caps onto crests, and the **wind-streak stretch** (`_FoamStreakStretch`) still
compresses the field coord perpendicular to the wind so the morphing blobs **elongate into streaks ALONG the
wind**. All three keep working *on top of* the evolving field + soft threshold.

**(C) Kill the residual REPEAT (painted whitecap tile).** The procedural `ValueNoise` is hash-based
(effectively non-tiling), so the procedural foam never tiled — but the painted **`_WhitecapTex`** slot
(`_UseWhitecapTex` ON) was sampled through a **plain `PaintUV`** (the only scrolling painted slot that
*skipped* the anti-tiling path), so its small seamless tile's **repeat grid** could read as the periodic
culprit. It is now routed through the existing **`UntileSampleW`** (IQ-style hash-untile + domain warp,
dialed by `_UntileStrength`), exactly like `_SurfaceTex`/`_FoamTex`/`_CausticTex`/`_SparkleTex` — kept
pixel-snapped. If a repeat still reads, raise `_UntileStrength` or lower `_WhitecapTexStrength`.

> **Why no C# uniform.** The evolving field and the soft threshold are derived **in-shader** off `_Time` and

### 5.10 Flow momentum — the water has MASS (shipped upgrade)

PR #95/#96 made the sim's **wind and tidal-current directions WANDER over time** (a deterministic drift,
P1 "sea has moods"). `WaterSurface.cs` pushes those live directions to the shader (`_FlowDir`/`_WindDir`,
§5.7), and the shader scrolls **every** wind/current-driven layer along them — so the moment the sim's
heading shifted, the surface motion **SNAPPED** to the new direction. The owner's note: *"when the water
changes direction of movement it shouldn't be instantaneous — it needs time to slow and change direction
from the newly applied force"* (water has mass).

This upgrade gives the pushed flow a **damped response** so the VISUAL surface motion **eases** toward the
live sim instead of snapping — decelerating through a heading change and accelerating out of it (momentum).
It lives **entirely in `WaterSurface.cs`** — **no shader change, no material property** (it's how the
uniforms are *fed*, not a new layer):

- **Smoothed vectors (the mechanism).** `WaterSurface` keeps persistent `Vector2` **smoothed twins** of the
  live `EnvironmentSample.CurrentVector` / `WindVector`. Each throttled push eases them toward the real sim
  vectors via frame-rate-independent **exponential smoothing**
  (`smoothed += (target − smoothed)·(1 − exp(−dt/τ))`, the pure static `SmoothVectorToward`), and **ALL**
  pushed uniforms are derived from the SMOOTHED vectors (`_Flow`/`_FlowDir` from smoothed current;
  `_WindDir`/`_Roughness` from smoothed wind — reusing the existing `FlowSpeed`/`FlowDirection`/
  `WindDirection`/`Roughness` helpers). So **every** wind/current-driven layer — current scroll, wind chop,
  rolling swell, foam streaks, foam drift — inherits the **same** momentum: the whole body eases round
  together (cohesive), not layer-by-layer.
- **Why smooth the VECTOR (not heading + magnitude apart).** When the flow reverses heading, the smoothed
  vector travels THROUGH a low-magnitude region as it rotates, so the surface **speed dips** mid-turn and
  recovers — *"slows, turns, then speeds back up"* for free. Smoothing heading and magnitude separately
  would hold the speed flat through the turn (the very snap we're removing).
- **One tunable (rule 6) — `Flow Response Time`** (`_flowResponseTime`, seconds, **default 3**). The time
  constant τ: heavier (larger) = more sluggish inertia; lighter (smaller) = livelier/snappier; **0 = no
  smoothing** (instant snap, the old behaviour). It is a **`WaterSurface` serialized field, NOT a material
  property** — the knob is on the component, tuned in the Inspector with no builder re-run. Frame-rate AND
  refresh-rate independent (the smoothing law composes, so the look doesn't change with `_refreshHz`).
- **Presentation only (rule 5).** This smooths the **visual** uniforms; it does **not** change the
  deterministic sim. The boat physics still read the **real** `EnvironmentSample` directly — only what the
  player SEES lags the sim slightly, and **that lag IS the momentum**. It saves nothing and feeds no
  simulation, exactly like the §5.6–§5.9 cosmetic layers.

The smoothing law has a pure-C# twin tested headless (`SmoothVectorToward` in `ArtRenderingTests.cs`): it
eases toward a steady target, the magnitude **dips below both endpoints on a reversal** (the slows-through-
the-turn property), it is **frame-rate independent** (sub-stepping reaches the same end state), and it is
deterministic — the guards for the momentum feel without opening Unity.

### 5.11 Foam density + whitecap lifecycle — dense solid core, milky edge, born-on-the-crest (shipped upgrade)

The §5.9 living-foam pass gave the foam a **soft (metaball) threshold** so blobs merge/separate — but the
owner saw it read **MILKY EVERYWHERE**, losing the **dense, solid-white** whitecaps the painted `_FoamTex`
(`_UseFoamTex` ON) used to give. The milky look is right for **calm / dissipating** foam, but a
**building / rough** sea needs solid density. The owner also wanted a natural **wave lifecycle**: foam
**forms** as waves build → peaks into dense **whitecaps** → **collapses** / dissipates. This pass is
**additive on #100/#101** — it keeps their merge/separate + the milky soft fade as the **LIGHT/dissipating
end**, and adds (1) a **dual-zone density** (solid-white core + milky edge), (2) **condition-driven density**
(sea-state widens/solidifies the foam), and (3) the **form→whitecap→collapse lifecycle**. Like every prior
addendum it is **visual-only** — it touches only `col.rgb` / `col.a` and **never** `depth`, `clip()`, the
deep-tint, the caustic gate, or `_WaterLevel`; it drives no sim and saves nothing (P1 integrity, CLAUDE.md
rule 5). Every constant is a material property (rule 6), every field stays **pixelized** (decision (2)), and
the new levers default **ON at a modest strength** so the change reads immediately yet dials fully back.

**(A) Dual-zone density — a SOLID-WHITE CORE + a milky soft edge (`SolidCore`, `FoamDensity`).** The #101
mask was a single `smoothstep(thr − soft, thr + soft, field)` — a smooth ramp, so even a field maximum only
reached partial coverage = milky. This pass keeps that smoothstep as the **milky band near the threshold
boundary**, but adds a **solid core**: where the evolving field is **WELL above** the threshold (above a new
`_FoamSolidThreshold`, which sits **above** `_FoamThreshold`), the foam coverage is lifted to **full
opacity** — `coverage = lerp(milky, 1, SolidCore(field))` — so the painted solid-white `_FoamTex` shows
through at the **dense heart**, with the milky smoothstep surviving only at the **soft edge**. Result: a
dense solid heart with soft milky edges, not milky-everywhere. Applied to **both** the shoreline foam fringe
and the open-water whitecaps.

**(B) Condition-driven density — calm sparse/milky, rough dense/solid/widespread (`FoamDensity`).** A master
`_FoamDensity` is **raised by wind** via `_FoamDensityWind` (× the existing `_Roughness`, which `WaterSurface`
already drives from the sim wind): `density = saturate(_FoamDensity + _Roughness · _FoamDensityWind)`. Density
both **lifts** the solid-core opacity and **widens** the solid zone (it slides the effective solid level
**down toward** the threshold as the sea roughens, so more of the field reads solid). So **CALM → sparse +
milky** (the #101 end) and **ROUGH → dense, solid, widespread whitecaps**, automatically, as the weather
shifts — the owner's "milky for some conditions, dense for others" with **no manual retuning**.

**(C) Wave lifecycle — form → peak → collapse, keyed off the swell crest (`WhitecapLifecycle`).** The
open-water whitecaps are tied to the **rolling-swell crest factor** (`SwellField`, §5.8 — reused, no new
field). A whitecap is **BORN dense & solid on the breaking crest** (a sharp break band at the crest top,
narrowed by `_WhitecapFormSharpness`, at `_WhitecapPeakDensity` opacity — which also **replaces the old hard
`0.6` cap-opacity ceiling**), then **AGES into milky residual** as the crest passes
(`crest^_WhitecapCollapseRate` decays the solid lift; faster rate = more milky residual off-crest), the
residual **spreading downwind** through the existing wind-streaked aniso coord (`_FoamStreakStretch`). Off the
crest / in the trough the solid lift fades to nothing and **only the milky soft mask remains** — exactly the
dissipating look #101 nailed. This is a **separate axis** from the existing `_FoamCrestGate` (which gates
*where* caps appear): the lifecycle shapes *how dense/solid* they are across their life stage.

> **in-shader** off the already-pushed `_Roughness`/`_WindDir`/`_FlowDir` + `_Time` — **no new uniform**,

### 5.12 Shoreward swell + foam bias — waves roll IN near the coast (shipped upgrade)

The owner saw the sea's surface artifacts / movement / foam appear to **ORIGINATE AT THE SHORELINE and travel
OUTWARD to sea** — "foam blowing out of the sand." It reads unnatural: a real ocean's swell and foam roll
**INWARD** toward the shore. **Root cause (a shader/sim direction split):** the cohesion pass (§5.8) keyed the
rolling **swell** axis (`SwellDir()`) and the **foam-drift** axis (`FoamDriftDir()`) off the **wind** (and the
tidal current) — both **wander over time** (the P1 "sea has moods" sim), and the wind blows **offshore part of
the time**. When the wind pointed land→sea, the swell crest bands and the near-shore foam streamed **OUT** from
the beach. Real swell is generated far offshore and propagates **shoreward regardless of the local wind**; foam
at the wet edge runs **up** the beach and recedes, it does not stream seaward.

The fix derives a per-pixel **shoreward direction from the seabed height map** the shader already samples, and
**biases** the swell + foam direction toward it **near the coast**, fading back to the wind/current direction in
deep water (the open sea keeps its §5.8 wind-driven cohesion). Like every prior addendum it is **visual-only** —
it steers only the swell-brightness bands + the foam/whitecap **dressing**, and **never** touches `depth`,
`clip()`, the deep tint, the caustic gate, or `_WaterLevel`; it drives no sim and saves nothing (P1 integrity,
CLAUDE.md rule 5). Every constant is a material property (rule 6), the gradient sampling stays **pixelized**
(decision (2)), and the bias defaults **ON at a modest strength** so the roll-in reads immediately yet dials
fully back. **Crucially the open sea is unchanged** — the bias fades to nothing past the falloff depth, so out at
sea the swell/foam still follow the wandering wind/current (the §5.8 cohesion). The wind may still scatter
chop/spray on top (§5.7) — this only stops it dragging the **wave trains + foam offshore near the beach**.

- **Shore direction from the height gradient (`ShoreDir`)** — the seabed elevation **rises toward land**, so the
  **gradient** of the elevation points toward shallower water = **toward the shore**. `ShoreDir(worldXY)` samples
  the baked `_HeightTex` (via `SeabedElevation`) at `± _ShoreSampleStep` metres on each axis (a central
  difference) and normalizes. It returns `(0,0)` on a flat seabed / when no height map is baked, so a region with
  no `TidalTerrain` (the open-water fallback) keeps the pure wind/current direction — **no behaviour change
  there**. Reads the **same** height map the depth/foam already use (one source of truth); it is a **visual
  direction only** — the gradient never feeds `depth`/`clip` (P1).
- **Near-shore weight (`ShorewardWeight`)** — **full** (= `_ShorewardBias`) at the wet edge (`depth ≈ 0`), fading
  smoothly to **0** by `_ShorewardFalloff` metres deep. So waves/foam roll in near the coast and the open sea is
  untouched. `_ShorewardBias = 0` disables it everywhere (the old wind-led behaviour).
- **Bias the swell + foam axes (`BiasTowardShore`)** — `SwellDir()` and `FoamDriftDir()` now `lerp` their existing
  wind/current axis toward `ShoreDir` by the near-shore weight, re-normalized (NaN-safe; a zero shore direction or
  zero weight returns the base axis unchanged). `SwellField` and both foam-drift call sites pass the per-pixel
  `depth`, so the crest **bands advance toward the beach** and the foam **runs up the shore** near the coast.

> **Why a C# twin (but not the gradient).** The height-gradient sampling is **GPU-side** (it reads `_HeightTex`)

## 6. Edges: tiles vs shader (the division of labour)

- **Static terrain-type boundaries** (grass↔sand↔rock; road/wharf edges) → **Rule Tiles** (the
  existing autotile approach, art-bible §5 / §2.1). These don't move, so they're authored once.
- **The live, moving waterline + foam** → **the shader** (the depth≈0 band, §5.3). The waterline moves
  with `WaterLevel` every tide; **do not re-stamp tiles per frame** — that's per-frame authoring churn
  and forks the shoreline truth away from the height map (ADR 0010 decision (4)).

Rule of thumb: *if it moves with the tide, it's in the shader; if it's a fixed material boundary, it's
a tile.*

## 7. Phasing & what lands when

| When | What | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Now (St Peters greybox)** | **Height map** + a **flat depth-tint** (shallow→deep colour, no animation) | world / gameplay | Gameplay-relevant: the height map *is* the walkability data (ADR 0009 seam). A readable depth tint aids the fun-check. **Not** the shader. |
| **M1 VS-24** | The water + global-grade **backbone** (art-bible §3.6/§6) | lead-architect + art-pipeline | The first real shader pass once mechanics prove fun & placeholder art is dropped. |
| **M2** | Wet-surface tide effects; foam fringe maturing on real region art | art-pipeline | art-bible §6.1. |
| **M3** | The heavy pass: runtime-shader **vs 3D-water→2D bake** decided by a profiled spike; parallax-underwater preview | lead-architect + art-pipeline | art-bible §6.1, OQ2. The layer recipe here applies either way. |

The full shader slots onto the **same height-map data** the greybox already authored — it is a new
*consumer* of an existing field, **no data migration**.

---

## 8. Determinism, save & performance (the guardrails)

- **Determinism (rule 5).** The render is a **pure function** of the deterministic `WaterLevelAt(t)`
  (recomputed from `(worldSeed, gameTime)`, never saved) + the authored read-only height map. Surface
  & caustic **animation** is driven by `time` for *visual motion only* — it feeds **no** simulation and
  influences **no** walkability, grounding, or saved state.
- **Save (ADR 0008).** Nothing about water rendering is saved; the height map is authored content, not
  save state.
- **Performance (ADR 0005 — 60fps desktop, mobile-portable).** A small fixed set of texture samples +
  noise per pixel; **no per-frame CPU allocation** (`WaterLevelAt` is a material float set on tide
  change / slow tick, not rebuilt per frame); pooled/static materials; mind texture memory for the
  foam/caustic/specular textures. The runtime-shader-vs-bake fork is a profiled call (§7, M3).

---

## 9. Open questions (for the art pass / owning lanes)

- **Height-map authoring source + a possible Core sampler.** ADR 0009 takes `terrainElevation` as a
  caller-supplied parameter; how the world authors it per position (tile heightfield texture vs
  per-feature zones — world-and-regions §9.4, time-tides-weather §3.5) and whether shader + sim should
  share a Core-owned **per-position sampler** is a build-time call (its own additive ADR if needed).
- **Runtime shader vs 3D-water→2D bake** (art-bible §6.1, OQ2) — profiled spike in the art pass.
- **Per-region water-plane offset** — a region that offsets its water plane from raw tide overrides
  `IEnvironmentService.WaterLevelAt`; the shader reads whatever that returns (no shader change).
- **Foam band width / depth thresholds / palette ramps / caustic intensity** — art-pipeline tunables,
  exposed as material/Def values (rule 6), not hard-coded in the graph.
- **Tide→visual-cue mapping (time-tides-weather OQ1).** This doc resolves the *rendering* side
  (continuous depth gradient + depth≈0 foam band); whether discrete waterline states / wet-dry tile
  swaps are *also* wanted for non-shader fallbacks is an art-pipeline call coordinated with that doc.

---

## 10. Owner-painted texture slots (art-direct beyond procedural)

> **Status: the owner's six hand-painted tiles are now IMPORTED + ASSIGNED.** They live at
> `Assets/_Project/Art/Textures/Water/` (`Foam.png`, `Caustics.png`, `SurfaceRipple.png`,
> `Whitecaps.png`, `Sparkle.png` 32×32, `DepthRamp.png` 256×8) and are wired into every matching slot
> on `Water.mat` with their `_Use…` toggles **ON** and each strength at the visible default `1`
> (`_PaintScale` 0.25 / `_SparkleTexScale` 0.5 left at defaults). They import as **Default** textures
> (not Sprite): **Point** filter, **no compression**, **mipmaps off** — **Repeat** wrap for the five
> seamless tiles, **Clamp** for the 1-D `DepthRamp`; **sRGB on** for the colour ramp, **off** for the
> five grayscale/mask tiles (per the import table below). So the default `Water.mat` now renders the
> owner's painted look; every strength remains a tunable to dial back toward the procedural fallback.

The shader's first pass draws every layer **procedurally** (value-noise + math) so it ships with no art
dependency. To let the owner/art-pipeline **art-direct the exact look**, the shader exposes **six
optional texture slots** on `Water.mat`. Each one **blends with or overrides the matching procedural
layer when assigned**, and **falls back to the shipped procedural look when the slot is empty** — so the
default material (every slot empty, every toggle off) renders *exactly* the first pass, unchanged.

**How the fallback works.** Each slot is paired with a `Use…` toggle (a shader keyword). The material
ships with all toggles **off** and all slots **empty**, so the procedural branch runs. To use a slot:
**assign the texture *and* tick its `Use…` toggle** in the Inspector. (Assigning a texture without
ticking the toggle does nothing — the toggle is the on-switch; this keeps the procedural path the
guaranteed default.) A per-slot **strength/blend** `[0..1]` then dials procedural ↔ painted
(`0` = pure procedural, `1` = fully painted), except `_DepthRamp`, which is a hard replace when on.

**Universal import settings for every slot** (so painted detail stays on-look):

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Filter Mode** | **Point (no filter)** | no bilinear AA — keeps the pixel-art read (LOCKED §3) |
| **Wrap Mode** | **Repeat** | a small seamless tile covers the whole sea plane |
| **Compression** | None (or high-quality) | avoid block-artefacts on tiny tiles |
| **sRGB** | **on** for `_DepthRamp` (it's colour); **off** for the grayscale/mask tiles | masks are data, not colour |
| **Alpha** | keep for the white-on-*transparent* tiles (foam, whitecap) | coverage comes from alpha |

All slots are sampled on the **pixelized world grid** (PPU-snapped, like every procedural layer) and
**tiled by `_PaintScale`** (tiles/unit; sparkle has its own finer `_SparkleTexScale`). Time-animated
layers (surface, caustics, sparkle, foam, whitecap) **scroll the painted tile with the current**, so a
single static tile still "swims" — no flip-book frames needed.

### The six slots

| Slot (material property) | Drives / blends into | On-switch + strength | Suggested authoring | Procedural fallback (slot empty) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`_SurfaceTex`** | the layer-2 surface ripple/wave detail — augments **or replaces** the procedural scrolling value-noise that produces swell + the surface tint + the foam/spec coords | `_UseSurfaceTex` · `_SurfaceTexStrength` | **~64×64**, **seamless**, **grayscale** (mid-grey ≈ flat; light/dark = crest/trough) | the two-octave scrolling value-noise (`SurfaceNoise`) |
| **`_FoamTex`** | the layer-3 foam fringe pattern, **masked to the waterline/shallows** (the depth≈0 band) — the painted shape breaks the foam line in place of the procedural churn | `_UseFoamTex` · `_FoamTexStrength` | **~64×64**, **seamless**, **white-on-transparent** (alpha = foam coverage; opaque tiles fall back to luminance) | the value-noise `churn` term inside the foam band |
| **`_CausticTex`** | the layer-5 caustics, **distorted by time** (two counter-scrolling samples) and **depth-gated to the shallows** — painted light-veins over the visible seabed | `_UseCausticTex` · `_CausticTexStrength` | **~64×64**, **seamless**, **grayscale** (bright = caustic vein) | the ridged dual-value-noise caustic, same shallow gate |
| **`_SparkleTex`** | the layer-4 specular glint pattern — replaces/blends the procedural posterized glint, still **gated by the implied-sun facing** (one-sun discipline, ADR 0006) | `_UseSparkleTex` · `_SparkleTexStrength` (+ `_SparkleTexScale`) | **~32×32**, **seamless**, **white-on-black** (white = a glint dot) | the noise-gradient facing glint, posterized to pixel sparkles |
| **`_DepthRamp`** | the layer-1 depth **colour** — a **1-D shallow→deep ramp** sampled by depth (`u=0` shallow → `u=1` deep). When assigned it **drives the depth colour instead of** the `_ShallowColor`/`_DeepColor` lerp (a hard replace; the depth-band posterization still applies *before* the lookup) | `_UseDepthRamp` (no strength — hard replace) | **64×1** or **256×1** (1px tall), **sRGB colour**, shallow at the **left** (`u=0`); alpha in the ramp drives water opacity too | the `lerp(_ShallowColor, _DeepColor, dt)` two-colour gradient |
| **`_WhitecapTex`** | the open-water, wind-driven whitecap pattern — coverage **scaled by the `_Roughness` (wind) uniform** and gated to deeper water, blended over the procedural speckle | `_UseWhitecapTex` · `_WhitecapTexStrength` | **~64×64**, **seamless**, **white-on-transparent** (alpha = cap coverage) | the wind-thresholded value-noise speckle |

> **Notes.**
> - `_PaintScale` (default `0.25` tiles/unit) sets how large the painted tiles read on the sea for all
>   slots except sparkle, which uses `_SparkleTexScale` (default `0.5`, finer). Both are tunables, not
>   hard-coded (rule 6).
> - **`_UntileStrength` (0..1, default `0.6`, ON)** breaks up the painted tiles' repeat grid (visible at
>   CALM) for the four scrolling slots — `_SurfaceTex`, `_FoamTex`, `_CausticTex`, `_SparkleTex` — via an
>   IQ-style hash-untile + domain warp, kept pixel-snapped. `0` = the raw grid; raise it until the tile
>   square stops reading. See §5.6(A).
> - Slots blend **in their own layer only** — e.g. a painted foam tile still appears *only* in the
>   depth≈0 band, painted caustics still fade out into deep water. The owner paints the *texture*; the
>   shader keeps the *placement* tied to the tide-truth (the P1 integrity rule — render and sim still
>   read one height map). A painted tile cannot move the waterline.
> - **Determinism & save (rule 5) are unaffected:** these are read-only authored textures sampled for
>   *visuals only*; they feed no simulation, influence no walkability/grounding, and enter no save —
>   exactly like the procedural look they replace.

### Ownership

Per [`../../agents/coordination.md`](../../agents/coordination.md) §1.1 ("Water/fog/lighting"):
**lead-architect** owns the **slot plumbing** (the properties, keywords, sampling, blend math — this
section); **art-pipeline** owns the **textures** (painting the seamless tiles + ramp to the §4 palette
and tuning the strengths). The slots are the seam where the two lanes meet — author the tiles to the
import table above and tune together.

## 11. Painted seabed-height authoring (ADR 0014) — hand-paint the §4 height map

The §4 height map (the *single source of truth* for render + walkability + boat-cross) can be authored
**two ways**, and they feed the **exact same** `depth = waterLevel − terrainHeight` equation:

1. **Analytic zones** (`World.TidalTerrain`) — elevation composed in code from a few blended zones
   (island / sandbar / channel / deep). The shipped St Peters default.
2. **A hand-painted height map** (`World.PaintedHeightMap`, ADR 0014) — the owner paints elevation with
   the **Terrain Paint Tool (height + look)** (`Hidden Harbours ▸ Tools ▸ Terrain Paint Tool (height +
   look)` — renamed from "Seabed Paint Tool"). The painted texture's R channel encodes elevation over a
   world rect + min/max range — **the same `_HeightTex` / `_HeightWorldMin` / `_HeightWorldSize` /
   `_HeightMin` / `_HeightMax` this shader already samples** (§5.1 `SeabedElevation`).

**Paint a terrain TYPE — look + height in ONE stroke.** The tool's headline brush paints a tunable terrain
*type* (Deep / Channel / Beach / Sandbar / Grass / Cliff): one stroke (a) sets the height-map cells to the
type's elevation AND (b) stamps the type's ground **tile** on the scene's ground tilemap (underwater types —
Deep / Channel — paint no tile and CLEAR any there, so the water shows). The **height side stays the single
source of truth** for water + tide (this section is unchanged by the type brush); the tile is authored
*visual* content, like normal Tile-Palette painting, never sim. A toggleable **edit-mode height colour
overlay** (deep blue → cyan → sand → green → rock, with a legend + the preview waterline) lets the owner SEE
the elevation he's shaping — a designer aid drawn ONLY in the Scene view that never serializes and never
renders in Play or a build (`World.TerrainHeightPalette` owns the pure ramp).

**One map, both consumers, no drift.** The painted texture is **CPU-readable**, so the sim decodes it once
into a cached `float[]` (`PaintedHeightField`, sampled by `PaintedTidalTerrain : ITidalTerrain`) using the
**identical** world→uv bilinear mapping this shader uses; the render feeds the **same texture** straight to
`_HeightTex` (`WaterSurface.DepthSource.PaintedHeightMap` — no re-bake). So the visible depth and the
gameplay depth come from the same bytes — the one-height-map / three-consumers rule (§4) holds by
construction. Painting forks neither a "visual seabed" nor a "physics seabed" — the exact drift §4 / ADR
0009 forbid.

**See the coast WHILE editing (the headline UX).** `WaterSurface` is `[ExecuteAlways]` with a serialized
**preview tide level**: in the Scene view (not playing) it drives `_WaterLevel` so the painted coast is
visible — land dry, the bar baring, the channel flooded — and a slider scrubs any tide WITHOUT pressing
Play. Presentation only (feeds no sim, saves nothing — rule 5); at runtime the live `WaterLevelAt(t)`
overrides it.

**Seed from today's coast.** "Export analytic St Peters → painted map" samples the shipped `TidalTerrain`
zones into a painted map (committed seed: `Assets/_Project/Data/Terrain/StPetersSeabed.asset`), so the owner
paints **from** the existing coast. Adopting the painted map (swap the scene's `TidalTerrain` for a
`PaintedTidalTerrain` + point `WaterSurface` at it) is an **explicit** step — the shipped St Peters look is
not silently changed.

**Determinism & save:** the painted map is **authored DATA committed like a tilemap** — read at runtime,
never written at runtime, no RNG; the tide is still recomputed from `(worldSeed, gameTime)` and nothing new
is saved (rule 5; ADR 0014).

---

## 11. Sky reflections — strong + sharp on CALM water, gone in a storm (shipped upgrade)

A reflection layer shipped on `HiddenHarboursWater.shader`: the sea now reflects the **sky**. On
**CALM / glassy** water it adds a clean, mirror-like sheen — the **current sky colour** smeared down the
surface plus a **brighter sun streak/glitter** sitting toward the sun. As the **sea-state** rises the
reflection **breaks up** (smears/scatters across the chop) and **fades**, reaching **~0 by a tunable
sea-state** (a storm doesn't mirror). So **calm → strong + sharp**, **lively → broken + dim**, **gale →
gone**. It serves **P1 ("The Sea Has Moods")**: the reflection *is* a sea-state tell.

It is a **faked, single-pass, in-shader** reflection — **NO reflection camera, NO extra render pass**
(those need wiring we can't verify and would blow the rule-7 perf budget). The "reflection" is the sky
colour stamped down the surface as a stylized **vertical-ish band** (the pixel-art cue for a mirror) plus a
sun-aligned glitter streak — pixelized on the PPU grid like every other layer (§3).

Like every prior addendum it is **visual-only** — it adds to `col.rgb` like every other water layer and
**never** touches `depth`, `clip()`, the deep tint, the caustic gate, or `_WaterLevel`; it drives no sim
and saves nothing (P1 integrity, CLAUDE.md rule 5). Every constant is a material property (rule 6). It is
composited **after** the caustics + specular (the mirror sits over them) but **before** the foam (so
whitecaps/fringe read on top of the reflection). **It defaults ON at a modest strength** so it reads
immediately, yet `_ReflectionStrength = 0` returns the exact pre-feature look.

### 11.1 Sea-state drives everything (NO new C# uniform)

The calm↔stormy behaviour is read **entirely from the sea-state uniforms `WaterSurface.cs` already
pushes** — `_Chop` (0 = glass .. 1 = storm; set from `Choppiness(SeaState)`) and `_Roughness` (the wind
whitecap scalar). **No new uniform push; `WaterSurface.cs` is untouched.** Two in-shader curves shape it,
each a pure function of those uniforms:

- **Strength** (`ReflectionStrength()`): `1` on glass, faded by `1 − smoothstep(0, _ReflectionFadeChop,
  _Chop)` to `0` by the fade-out sea-state, **further dimmed** by wind (`1 − _Roughness·_ReflectionWindFade`),
  scaled by the master `_ReflectionStrength`. So a storm (or master 0) yields no reflection.
- **Sharpness** (`ReflectionSharpness()`): `1` (a clean mirror) at calm, falling toward `0` (smeared)
  against a combined agitation `_Chop·_ReflectionChopScatter + _Roughness·_ReflectionWindScatter`. The
  shader uses it to **widen the vertical smear** (a sharp mirror is a tight band; a smeared one is broad)
  and to **broaden the sun streak**.

### 11.2 The reflection reflects the CURRENT sky (day/night)

The reflected sky colour is the **day/night `_DayNightTint` global** (the same sky/scene colour the
DayNightController multiplies the frame by, ADR 0013) so the mirror reads **warm at dusk, dark at night,
bright at noon** — dialed by `_ReflectionSkyTint` against the material's `_ReflectionColor` base. The
**sun streak** sits toward `_SunDir` (the same global the specular uses) and **fades out as the sun sets**
(`_SunElevation`). When the day/night cycle is **not running** (the global defaults to near-black /
`_SunDir == 0` — e.g. a bare art scene or editor preview) the layer falls back to the authored
`_ReflectionColor` and treats the sun as up — mirroring the specular's existing `_SunDir == 0` fallback,
so it never paints a black sky from an unset global.

### 11.3 Tunables (all additive — none of the owner's existing tuned values changed)

| Property | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `_ReflectionStrength` | 0.6 | **Master** opacity. **0 = off / today's look.** |
| `_ReflectionFadeChop` | 0.6 | the `_Chop` sea-state at which the reflection has fully faded to nothing. |
| `_ReflectionWindFade` | 0.5 | how much wind/`_Roughness` **additionally dims** it (0 = wind ignored). |
| `_ReflectionChopScatter` | 1.5 | how much chop **smears** (softens) the reflection. |
| `_ReflectionWindScatter` | 0.8 | how much wind **smears** the reflection. |
| `_ReflectionSkyTint` | 0.85 | weight of the live day/night sky vs `_ReflectionColor`. |
| `_ReflectionColor` | (0.62,0.74,0.86,1) | base reflected-sky colour (used when the cycle is off). |
| `_ReflectionSmear` | 1.6 m | vertical smear length of a SHARP (calm) reflection. |
| `_ReflectionSunStreak` | 0.9 | intensity of the brighter sun glitter/streak. |
| `_ReflectionSunSharp` | 6.0 | tightness of the sun streak at calm (higher = narrower/hotter). |

To turn reflections OFF entirely (the pre-feature look), set `_ReflectionStrength = 0`.

### 11.4 Determinism guard (headless C# twin)

The reflection FIELD (the smear band + glitter) is GPU value-noise (not unit-testable headless), but the
**sea-state response curves** — the part that decides *how strong* and *how sharp* the reflection reads as
the sea changes mood — are pure functions mirrored as C# twins in
`Assets/_Project/Code/Art/WaterReflection.cs` (`WaterReflection.ReflectionStrength` /
`ReflectionSharpness`, reusing `WaterSurface.Smoothstep`), unit-tested headless in
`Assets/Tests/EditMode/Art/WaterReflectionTests.cs`: strength is full on glass, monotonically fades to 0 by
the fade-chop and stays gone past it, wind dims it further, and the master 0 turns it off at every
sea-state; sharpness is a mirror at calm and smears monotonically toward 0 with chop + wind, clamped (no
negative smear). The twins are **not pushed** to the material and **not** in `WaterSurface.cs` — they read
the existing sea-state uniforms, so there is no new C# uniform. The CI shader-compile guard
(`WaterShaderCompileGuardTests.cs`) continues to force-compile the shipped `Water.mat` variant: no `+` in
any `[Header]`/property string, no `[unroll]` over a runtime bound (the magenta class stays guarded).

### 11.5 Sky CONTENT — drifting clouds, a LIVING moon glitter path, faint stars (shipped upgrade)

§11 reflected the sky *colour* + a sun glint. **Because this is a ¾ top-down game the player never sees the
sky directly — the water's reflection is the ONLY place the sky appears** — so the owner asked for the sky's
*content* to reflect too. This layer adds three things ON TOP of the §11 mirror, all in
`SkyContentReflection()` (the DAY share is composited after `SkyReflection()`, before the foam; the NIGHT-gated
share is composited after the palette grade, overlay-compensated — see §11.6):

1. **Drifting CLOUDS (day + night).** Soft, elongated pale bands built from an FBM field on a coord
   **compressed across the wind** (so the cloud cells elongate into wisps ALONG it) and **scrolled along the
   shared sim wind** global `_WindWorld` (the SAME wind the grass + water already read — declared here as a
   read-only global; **no new push**, falling back to a gentle +X creep when nothing publishes it). A soft
   threshold (`_CloudSoftness`) shapes pale clumps with clear sky between; the clouds tint toward the current
   sky (warm at dusk). `_CloudStrength` / `_CloudScale` / `_CloudDriftSpeed` / `_CloudColor` tune them.
   The cloud FBM coord is **camera-anchored** (`worldXY − _WorldSpaceCameraPos.xy`) exactly like the moon
   disc below, so distant clouds — a reflection of the sky at infinity — **stay put as the follow-cam tracks
   the sailing boat** and drift **only** with the wind at `_CloudDriftSpeed` (owner playtest fix, 2026-07-05:
   sampling the raw `worldXY` scrolled them past at BOAT speed, which is why lowering `_CloudDriftSpeed` alone
   never fixed it — that dial only rode ON TOP of the boat-motion scroll). `_WorldSpaceCameraPos` is the URP
   built-in the moon/sun anchors already read — no new uniform. (Stars remain world-anchored, unchanged.)
2. **The LIVING MOON** — a reflected disc + a shimmering **vertical GLITTER PATH** (the classic moonlight
   column: broken, wavy, animated highlights descending toward the viewer; pixelized so it reads as pixel
   art). The money shot on **calm night water**. It is **alive**:
   - **It MOVES** — the moon rises east, arcs overhead, and sets west across the night, so the reflected disc +
     glitter **travel** over the water. The current arc direction comes from the **`_MoonDir` global**
     published by the new self-installing **`MoonCycle`** service (mirrors `GrassWindBridge` /
     `DayNightController`; reads `GameServices.Clock`; **`DayNightController` is NOT touched**).
   - **It is ANCHORED AT THE CAMERA** — the reflected disc sits offset along the arc direction from the
     **camera's ground position** (`_WorldSpaceCameraPos.xy`), so it travels **with the viewer** like a real
     reflection of a body at infinity (the classic "the moon follows you along the shore") and always lands on
     water near the play area. (It was anchored at the height-map world centre — on St Peters that is the
     middle of the bared **sandbar**, ~40 m from the play area, so the owner never actually saw it.)
   - **It has PHASES** — `_MoonPhaseState` carries a signed **terminator** the shader carves the disc with
     (new → crescent → quarter → gibbous → full → waning), and a **brightness** that dims a thin crescent.
   - **It is TIED TO THE TIDES** — `MoonMath.Phase01` derives the phase from the **same lunar period** that
     drives `TideModel`'s spring/neap envelope, so **full moon ↔ spring tide** (proved in a headless test;
     vision-and-pillars §5.5). A tunable links per-night presence to phase: a **new moon** is a genuinely dark
     night you need the boat spotlight for (P1/P5). Tunables: `_MoonStrength` / `_MoonSize` / `_MoonGlitter` /
     `_MoonGlitterLength` / `_MoonColor` on the material; the lunar period + moonrise/set + phase→presence on
     `MoonCycle`.
3. **Faint STAR sparkle (night).** Tiny, sparse, per-cell-phased twinkling glints from a high-frequency hash
   field, pixelized to single pixels, very subtle. `_StarStrength` / `_StarDensity` / `_StarTwinkleSpeed`.
4. **The SUN GLITTER PATH (golden hour)** — the moon column's daytime/dusk twin: a **warm golden glitter
   column toward the LOW sun** at dawn and dusk (the classic "path of light to the sun" across calm water).
   Same camera-anchored column structure as the moon's glitter path (decorrelated noise so the two never read
   as copies), but gated by **`SunGlitterGate` over `_SunElevation`** instead of night: it rises just above
   the horizon (full by elevation 0.02), holds through the low-sun band, and is **gone by ~0.5 elevation** (a
   high sun glints via the specular, not a column) and **at/below the horizon** (the moon takes over; the
   unset cycle-off elevation of 0 also gates it to 0 — no phantom glitter in a bare scene). It **reuses the
   moon's geometry knobs** (`_MoonGlitterLength` = reach, `_MoonSize` = width basis; rule 6) and adds only
   two tunables: **`_SunGlitterStrength`** (default 0.6; 0 = off) and **`_SunGlitterColor`** (warm gold
   `(1.0, 0.82, 0.55)`). It is routed into the **compensated post-grade share** (§11.6, alongside the
   moon/stars/boat beam) so the dusk tint's downstream multiply can't mute its authored warm gold — at midday
   the tint is ~1 so the compensation is a natural no-op, and the gate is ~0 there anyway (midday water is
   effectively unchanged). Inherits the sea-state fade + sharpness smear like all sky content.

**Invariants (all hold):** everything **inherits the §11 sea-state fade** (reuses `ReflectionStrength()` /
`ReflectionSharpness()` — strong on CALM, gone in chop/storm); the moon + stars additionally **gate by night**
(`NightFactor()`, the darkness of the global `_DayNightTint`, the same convention the boat-light night-gate
uses), clouds read day + night. It is **col.rgb-only** — the DAY share is added before the foam and graded by
the **palette guard-rail** as before; the NIGHT-gated share is added **after** the grade, pre-compensated for
the day/night multiply overlay so complete dark can't crush it (§11.6) — it composes with the day/night
overlay (multiplies on top) and the weather palette. **`_SkyReflectionStrength = 0` returns the §11
look.** `WaterSurface.cs` is **untouched** (no new water uniform).

**Determinism guard.** The cloud/moon/star FIELDS are GPU value-noise (not unit-testable headless), but the
moon's deterministic state is pure: `Assets/_Project/Code/Art/MoonMath.cs` (`Phase01`, `IlluminatedFraction`,
`TerminatorSigned`, `MoonArc`, `NightProgress`) + `MoonCycle.ComputeState` are unit-tested in
`Assets/Tests/EditMode/Art/MoonMathTests.cs` (phase cycles 0..1, full-moon-on-spring-tide /
quarter-on-neap, arc rises→peaks→sets, down by day, new dimmer than full). The reflection-curve twins gain
`WaterReflection.MoonDirection` / `NightFactor` / `SkyElementStrength`, tested in `WaterReflectionTests.cs`.
The sun glitter's golden-hour window is the pure twin `WaterReflection.SunGlitterGate` (window constants
`SunGlitterRiseEnd` / `SunGlitterFallStart` / `SunGlitterFallEnd`), pinned there too (zero at/below the
horizon, peak through the low-sun band, gone by high sun, monotonic dawn rise / noon fall).

### 11.6 Complete-dark fix — light content is PRE-COMPENSATED for the day/night multiply (post-grade)

The owner reported two night-visual bugs with the same root cause: at **complete dark** the boat spotlight's
water beam and the reflected moon/glitter/stars all but vanish. The day/night system (ADR 0013) draws a
whole-frame **MULTIPLY** overlay after the water renders; at deepest night the tint is
`skyTint(0.12, 0.16, 0.34) × intensity floor 0.18 ≈ (0.022, 0.029, 0.061)`, so any light the water added to
itself survived on screen at **~3–6%, blue-shifted**. A secondary crusher: at deep night the §13 palette
grade's day/night value floor saturates (`floorPre = 1`) and pulls **all** pre-overlay water toward luma 1 at
`_PaletteGradeStrength`, flattening lit-vs-unlit contrast.

**The fix (in `HiddenHarboursWater.shader`'s `frag()`):** the light content — `BoatLightTerm()` plus the
NIGHT-gated share of `SkyContentReflection()` (moon disc + glitter + stars + the clouds' night portion) — is
now added **after `PaletteGrade()`**, divided by `max(_DayNightTint.rgb, DN_COMP_MIN_CHANNEL)` so the
overlay's downstream multiply **cancels** and the light reads at its authored brightness however dark the
night is. This is the same pre-compensation pattern the guard-rail's `PaletteValueFloorDayNight` already uses
(ADR 0015). Key properties:

- **`DN_COMP_MIN_CHANNEL = 0.02`** bounds the boost at ≤ 50× so a near-zero tint channel can't explode the
  divide; the shipped deepest-night channels all exceed it, so cancellation there is **exact** (no hue shift).
- **Daylight is pixel-identical**: the beam is night-gated to 0 by day, the night share is 0 by day, and the
  clouds' day share still composes pre-grade exactly where the whole layer used to sit. The two cloud shares
  always sum to the original term, so dusk carries no discontinuity.
- **Cycle off (edit mode / bare art scene / demo)**: the tint global is near-black (unset) → the content is
  added **raw** (there is no overlay to compensate for) — the tuning/preview look is preserved.
- **HDR dependency**: this works because the URP asset has **HDR ON** (`UniversalRP.asset m_SupportsHDR: 1`) —
  the compensated values are far above 1 and must survive the framebuffer to reach the overlay's multiply. A
  later mobile port that disables HDR silently regresses this; re-check there.
- **Post-grade on purpose**: the guard-rail still bounds the SEA the light sits on, but no longer clamps the
  compensated (>1) light values or floor-flattens the lit pool. Known side-effect: once the water-beam's
  night gate saturates (~mid-dusk) the lit pool reads at full authored brightness — brighter than the crushed
  look the owner saw at dusk; it stays tunable via the existing beam strength.
- **Determinism guard**: the divide is mirrored headless in `LightMath.CompensateForDayNightTint`
  (+ `LightMath.DayNightCompensationMinChannel`) and pinned in `LightMathTests` (on-screen constancy across
  tint luminances, exact deepest-night cancellation, cycle-off untouched, the 50× bound).

## 12. Water presets — saved sea-mood material variants + the apply/generate/save menu

> The owner asked to *"save the current ocean tune as a material preset, along with several variations."*
> This section is the result: a small **library of complete `HiddenHarbours/Water` material variants**, each a
> distinct sea MOOD, plus an editor menu to **apply** one onto the live water, **generate** native Unity
> `.preset` assets, and **save** the owner's own tune as a new variant. It is **art-direction only** — no
> shader, code-sim, or save change (rule 5). Tunable: every value lives on the material assets (rule 6).

### 12.1 The sim-override caveat (read this first)

At runtime the `WaterSurface` component **overrides** the sim-driven knobs — `_Chop`, `_Roughness`, `_Flow`,
`_FlowDir`, `_WindDir` — from the deterministic sea-state every tick (§0, ADR 0010/0013). So **calm vs storm
happens automatically with the weather**, on *any* preset: a preset cannot make the sea permanently flat or
permanently raging. A preset instead expresses mood through the **non-sim-overridden VISUAL knobs**:

- **Palette** — `_DeepColor` / `_ShallowColor` / `_FoamColor` / `_SpecColor` / `_CausticColor` /
  `_ReflectionColor` / `_FbmTint`, plus `_SurfaceTint` and `_DepthBands`.
- **Foam character** — `_FoamDensity` / `_FoamDensityWind` / `_FoamThreshold(Soft)` / `_FoamSolidThreshold` /
  `_FoamStreakStretch` / the `_Whitecap*` lifecycle (form sharpness / peak density / collapse rate).
- **Swell** — `_OceanSwellStrength` / `_OceanSwellScale` / `_OceanSwellSharpness` (the rolling cohesion bands).
- **Specular** — `_SpecAmount` / `_SpecSharpness` / `_SpecSwellBias`.
- **Caustics** — `_CausticAmount` / `_CausticScale` / `_CausticDepth`.
- **Reflection** — `_ReflectionStrength` / `_ReflectionColor` / `_ReflectionSkyTint` / `_ReflectionSmear` /
  `_ReflectionSunStreak(Sharp)` / the chop+wind scatter/fade knobs.

The **structural** knobs are **identical** across every variant (so applying one never moves the gameplay
waterline): the height map (`_HeightMin/Max/WorldMin/WorldSize`), `_WaterLevel`, every `_Use*` keyword toggle,
the painted texture references, `_PixelsPerUnit`, `_PaintScale`, and the shoreward bias
(`_ShorewardBias/Falloff`, `_ShoreSampleStep`). The sim-driven knobs above are also left at the base value
(they're overwritten at runtime anyway). Each variant is therefore a **complete, valid `HiddenHarbours/Water`
material** — assigning it to the Sea "just works", and the CI magenta guard (`WaterShaderCompileGuardTests`)
force-compiles every one.

### 12.2 The variant library (`Assets/_Project/Art/Materials/WaterPresets/`)

| Variant | Mood (one line) |
|---|---|
| **Water_NorthAtlantic** | The current shipped tune **verbatim** — the cold teal-navy "home" / default. |
| **Water_GlassyCalm** | The mirror showcase: reflections up + sharp, restrained milky foam, gentle round swell, soft cool spec, clear cold caustics. Serene. |
| **Water_StormGrey** | Cold grey gloom (P5 teeth): desaturated grey-blue palette, dense whiter whitecaps, stronger broader swell, reflection near-off (storms don't mirror), dark brooding deeps. |
| **Water_FoggySmother** | Pale, desaturated, low-contrast, eerie (The Smother): washed cold-grey colours, minimal spec + caustics, a soft diffuse pale reflection, low-contrast foam. |
| **Water_WarmShelter** | A gentler, slightly **warmer** sheltered-harbour mood: warmer shallow + spec + reflection tint (tasteful, not tropical), calmer foam, a touch more caustic clarity. |

All five are cold North-Atlantic-family except **WarmShelter**, which leans a careful step warmer for the
sheltered-harbour feel — still in-palette.

### 12.3 The menu (`Hidden Harbours ▸ Art ▸ Water Presets`)

The editor menu lives in `Assets/_Project/Art/Editor/WaterPresetMenu.cs`:

1. **Apply to live Water ▸ &lt;variant&gt;** — the recommended non-dev path. Copies the chosen variant's shader
   properties onto the shipped `Assets/_Project/Art/Materials/Water.mat` (via `CopyPropertiesFromMaterial`),
   then dirties + saves it. Because the St Peters Sea plane uses `Water.mat` (`StPetersBuilder` hard-sets
   `sharedMaterial = Water.mat`), this swaps the in-game look **immediately** AND **survives a "Build St Peters
   Scene" re-run**. It asks before overwriting and is **Undo-able** (Edit ▸ Undo). One item per variant.
2. **Generate native .preset assets** — creates a real Unity `UnityEditor.Presets.Preset` (`new Preset(mat)`)
   next to each variant `.mat` in the WaterPresets folder. These are genuine Unity "material presets" the owner
   can drag onto any material's Inspector. They are **generated by this menu** (Unity authors them at runtime),
   never hand-written `.preset` YAML (fragile).
3. **Save current Water as new variant...** — duplicates the live, tuned `Water.mat` into the WaterPresets
   folder under a name the owner picks (a save dialog), so the owner can bank his own tweaks as a reusable
   preset variant.

The live `Water.mat` is **only ever changed by the explicit "Apply" command** (that is the intent) — the
variants are read-only sources the menu copies *from*.

## 13. Palette guard-rail — a tunable final-stage soft grade that bounds the sea to a palette (ADR 0015)

> The owner asked for a **guard-rail** on the water's FINAL output so the increasingly rich, sea-state-driven
> look (§5.6–§11) can never **wash out** (too bright) or go **muddy** (too dark), while keeping the dynamic
> diversity. He chose **SOFT** rails — bound the extremes and gently PULL toward the palette, **NOT a hard
> lock**. This section is the result: a **final colour-grade stage** in the water frag (`col.rgb` only, the
> LAST thing before `return col`) plus **palette presets** integrated with the §12 library. Decision of
> record: [`../adr/0015-water-palette-guard-rail.md`](../adr/0015-water-palette-guard-rail.md).

### 13.1 What the grade does (three soft ops, scaled by a master)

After every layer composites, `PaletteGrade(col.rgb, dayNightLuma)` applies, in order:

1. **VALUE (luminance) FLOOR + CEILING** — no mud, no blowout. A hue-preserving multiplicative re-scale
   clamps the colour's luminance into `[floor, ceil]`. The **floor is DAY/NIGHT-AWARE** (see §13.2); the
   ceiling is a plain luminance cap.
2. **SATURATION CAP** — HSV-style `(max−min)/max` capped at `_PaletteSatCap`; above the cap the colour is
   pulled toward its own grey just enough to hit the cap (luminance preserved — it only desaturates).
3. **ANCHOR PULL** — a soft `lerp` toward the **nearest palette anchor by luminance** (a continuous
   piecewise blend across `_PaletteDeep` / `_PaletteMid` / `_PaletteShallow` / `_PaletteFoam`) at
   `_PalettePullStrength` (~0.3–0.4 — a rail, not a cage).

The whole graded result is lerped back toward the raw colour by the master `_PaletteGradeStrength`, so
**`_PaletteGradeStrength = 0` is an EXACT passthrough (today's look, byte-for-byte)** — opt-in + revertible.
It is composited **after** the foam/whitecaps (it bounds the *finished* colour). `col.rgb` ONLY: it never
touches `depth` / `clip()` / the deep tint / the caustic gate / `_WaterLevel` / the height read / the sim
(P1 integrity, CLAUDE.md rule 5); it drives no sim and saves nothing.

### 13.2 The day/night floor — never muddy in daylight, still dark at true night (the subtle part)

The day/night system (ADR 0013) draws a **full-screen MULTIPLY overlay ABOVE the water** that multiplies the
WHOLE composited frame by the global `_DayNightTint`. So whatever the water shader emits is **multiplied
downstream** by the day/night tint's luminance. A naive constant floor in the water shader would be
**darkened away** by that multiply — forcing a bad choice between *daylight muddy* (floor too low) or
*killing the genuinely-dark nights* (floor too high).

The fix is **pre-compensation**: the water floors its PRE-overlay luminance at

```
floorPre = min(1, paletteFloor / max(dayNightLuma, eps))
```

so that AFTER the overlay's `× dayNightLuma`:

- **Daylight / overcast** (`dayNightLuma ≈ 1`): `floorPre ≈ paletteFloor` → the on-screen water lands at
  ~`paletteFloor` — **never muddy**.
- **True night** (`dayNightLuma` small): the quotient **saturates at 1** (water full-bright pre-overlay), so
  the overlay still multiplies it down to **genuine dark** — the owner's dark-nights vision is preserved.

`_PaletteNightFloor` (an on-screen luminance, default **0**) optionally keeps a faint readable sea at night
(it raises the deep-night floor a touch, inert in daylight). **`_PaletteNightFloor = 0` lets night go as dark
as the overlay takes it** (the default). When the day/night cycle is NOT running the global `_DayNightTint`
is near-black (the same "unset" convention the reflection/specular use) — the grade then treats it as full
daylight (`dayNightLuma = 1`, the daylight rail) so a bare art scene / editor preview never paints a
phantom-dark floor.

### 13.3 Palette presets (the palette IS a material property set)

A palette = its four **anchor colours** + its **bounds** (floor / ceil / sat-cap / pull-strength /
night-floor), all material properties, so a Water variant **carries its palette**. The live `Water.mat`
ships **North Atlantic** at the soft default (`_PaletteGradeStrength = 0.35`). Three NEW palette variants
join `WaterPresets/` alongside the §12 moods:

| Variant | Palette (one line) |
|---|---|
| **Water_StirredBrown** | Turbid brown-green estuary: low saturation, mid value, muddy olive-tan anchors. |
| **Water_DeepBlue** | Saturated deep open-ocean blue: higher contrast, vivid navy→blue-teal anchors. |
| **Water_Tropical** | Turquoise / cyan, brighter higher-sat shallows — the deliberate WARM/BRIGHT outlier (everything else is cold North-Atlantic-canon). |

The existing 5 mood variants gained the **same palette property key set** with per-mood-appropriate bounds
(e.g. StormGrey: low floor + low ceiling + tight sat-cap + stronger pull for cold gloom; FoggySmother:
high floor + tight sat-cap for pale low-contrast eerie), so **every variant is a complete material with one
property key set** (the CI magenta guard force-compiles them all). All eight appear in the
`Hidden Harbours ▸ Art ▸ Water Presets ▸ Apply to live Water` submenu and the "Generate native .preset
assets" list (`WaterPresetMenu.cs`).

### 13.4 Tunables (all additive; `_PaletteGradeStrength = 0` = the pre-feature look)

| Property | Default (Water.mat) | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `_PaletteGradeStrength` | 0.35 | **Master** — lerps the whole grade back toward raw. **0 = today's look.** |
| `_PaletteValueFloor` | 0.10 | Daylight on-screen luminance FLOOR (no mud). |
| `_PaletteValueCeil` | 0.85 | Luminance CEILING (no blowout). |
| `_PaletteSatCap` | 0.55 | HSV-style saturation CAP. |
| `_PalettePullStrength` | 0.35 | Anchor PULL strength (soft; a rail). |
| `_PaletteNightFloor` | 0.0 | On-screen luminance floor permitted at NIGHT (0 = night goes dark). |
| `_PaletteDeep/Mid/Shallow/Foam` | (palette) | The four anchor colours the grade pulls toward, by luminance. |

To turn the guard-rail fully off (the pre-feature look), set `_PaletteGradeStrength = 0`. The floor + ceiling
live in `_PaletteValueFloor` / `_PaletteValueCeil`; switch palettes via the preset menu (§12.3).

### 13.5 Determinism guard (headless C# twin)

The grade math is mirrored exactly in a pure `Assets/_Project/Code/Art/WaterPaletteGrade.cs`
(`WaterPaletteGrade.Grade` + `ValueFloorDayNight` / `CapSaturation` / `AnchorForLuma` / `ScaleToLuminance`)
and locked headless in `Assets/Tests/EditMode/Art/WaterPaletteGradeTests.cs`: strength 0 = identity at every
input + day/night state; the floor lifts mud to the palette floor in daylight and the pre-comp lands
on-screen at the palette floor after the multiply; **true night still reaches genuinely dark**; the night
floor keeps a faint sea only when asked; the ceiling caps blowout; the sat cap desaturates while preserving
luminance; the anchor pull is soft (moves toward, never snaps to, the anchor) and continuous in luminance.
The CI shader-compile guard (`WaterShaderCompileGuardTests.cs`) continues to force-compile the shipped
`Water.mat` AND every WaterPresets variant: no `+` in any `[Header]`/property string, no `[unroll]` over a
runtime bound (the magenta class stays guarded), and every variant carries the same `_Palette*` key set.

## 14. Weather-driven water palette — the deterministic weather EASES the sea's mood through the presets (ADR 0017)

> The owner asked the weather to *"cycle through the water presets, in a realistic fashion."* This section is
> the result: a runtime **weather → water-mood** blend on `WaterSurface` that, when enabled, EASES the sea's
> MOOD/COLOUR through the §12 preset library as the **deterministic** `EnvironmentSample` shifts (calm ↔ storm
> by sea-state, pulled toward fog by low visibility — P1 "the sea has moods"). It is **opt-in** (off = today's
> static look), **MPB-only** (the `Water.mat` asset is never written), and it drives **only** the mood props —
> **never** the physics props `WaterSurface` already feeds from the sim. Decision of record:
> [`../adr/0017-weather-driven-water-palette.md`](../adr/0017-weather-driven-water-palette.md). This **answers
> the §13 / ADR 0015 open question** ("per-region palette by mood/weather").

### 14.1 The realistic model (a pure 2-axis blend across four anchor moods)

`WeatherWaterPalette` (a pure C# static class, `Assets/_Project/Code/Art/WeatherWaterPalette.cs`) turns the
deterministic sample into 0..1 weights over **four anchor preset MOODS** — a region **BASE**, a **CALM** mood,
a **STORM** mood, and a **FOG** mood — that sum to 1:

1. **Sea-state axis** — `SeaStateAxis01(SeaState)` (Glass=0 .. Storm=1), shaped by a tunable threshold + curve
   (`ShapeAxis`), drives a **CALM ↔ STORM** lerp. Low sea-state = serene; rising = the greyer/choppier/
   desaturated **Storm** mood.
2. **Fog axis** — `(1 − Visibility)`, shaped by its own threshold + curve, pulls the whole mood toward the
   **FOG** mood (pale, desaturated, low-contrast, soft).
3. **Combine** — the sea-state lerp makes a calm↔storm base mood; the fog amount then pulls THAT toward fog:
   `storm = (1−fog)·seaAmt`, `calm = (1−fog)·(1−seaAmt)·calmReach`, `fog = fogAmt`, the **base** backfilling
   the rest. So a **foggy storm reads mostly fog** (the smother dominates), a **foggy calm reads pale-serene**,
   and a **clear gale reads storm** — the realistic ordering.

The default anchors (St Peters) — the calm/storm/fog presets are from `Art/Materials/WaterPresets/`; the
**BASE / calm anchor is left UNWIRED so it resolves to the Sea's own LIVE `Water.mat`** (the calm baseline
then tracks the owner's `Water.mat` tuning; weather-off / strength-0 = exactly `Water.mat` — ADR 0017):

| Axis end | Anchor preset | Mood |
|---|---|---|
| **Base** (fair/clear/calm-ish) | _unwired_ → the live `Water.mat` | the renderer's own tuned look (the cold teal-navy "home"); assign an explicit preset only to *pin* the calm look |
| **Calm** (lowest sea-state) | `Water_GlassyCalm` | serene mirror, gentle swell, restrained foam |
| **Storm** (highest sea-state) | `Water_StormGrey` | grey gloom, dense whitecaps, reflection near-off |
| **Fog** (lowest visibility) | `Water_FoggySmother` | pale, low-contrast, soft, eerie |

### 14.2 Integration — `WaterSurface`'s opt-in mode, pushed via the EXISTING MPB

`WaterSurface` already reads the `EnvironmentSample` each throttled tick and owns the per-renderer
`MaterialPropertyBlock`. The weather blend is an **opt-in mode** on it (master enable + strength, four
assignable anchor materials, the axis tunables). Each tick — the same tick that pushes the physics props — it:

1. reads the `EnvironmentSample`;
2. computes the target weights (`WeatherWaterPalette.BlendWeightsNonAlloc`, no alloc);
3. **EASES** the visible weights toward the target (`EaseWeights` — a frame-rate-independent exponential ease,
   the same form as the flow-momentum `SmoothVectorToward`, so the mood never POPS; first push snaps);
4. applies the master **strength** (`ApplyStrengthInPlace` — lerp the weights back toward the BASE anchor;
   **0 = base only = today's look**);
5. blends the MOOD props by reading each anchor material's value **per key** and writing the weighted result
   onto the **same** MPB — alongside (never replacing) the physics props.

Because it rides the MPB it **never mutates `Water.mat`** (rule 5) and is **cleared on disable** like every
other `WaterSurface` override.

### 14.3 What it blends — only the mood/colour props (DISJOINT from the physics props)

The blend writes exactly the §12.1 **non-sim-overridden** keys (palette grade `_Palette*`; colours
`_DeepColor`/`_ShallowColor`/`_FoamColor`/`_SpecColor`/`_FbmTint`/`_CausticColor`/`_ReflectionColor`; swell
`_OceanSwellStrength`/`Sharpness`/`Scale`; foam character `_FoamDensity`/`_FoamThreshold*`/`_FoamStreakStretch`/
`_FoamSolidThreshold`/`_FoamCrestGate`/`_FoamSoftness`/`_FoamWidth`/`_FoamNoise`/`_FoamTexStrength`/
`_WhitecapTexStrength`/`_Whitecap*`; `_SurfaceTint`/`_SurfaceTexStrength`/`_FbmStrength`/`_SparkleTexStrength`;
specular `_SpecAmount`/`_SpecSharpness`/`_SpecSwellBias`; caustics `_CausticAmount`/`_CausticScale`/
`_CausticDepth`/`_CausticTexStrength`; reflection `_Reflection*`). The key set is **read from the anchor
materials at runtime** (per-key, `HasProperty`-guarded), so it **can't drift** from what the presets carry.

It **deliberately EXCLUDES** every PHYSICS prop `WaterSurface` already drives — `_Chop`, `_Roughness`, `_Flow`,
`_FlowDir`, `_WindDir`, `_WaterLevel`, `_HeightTex`/`_Height*`. The two sets are **disjoint and compose**: the
sim drives the motion (chop/foam roughen physically with the sea-state), the weather blend sets the look. **No
double-drive.**

### 14.4 Composition (guard-rail + day/night)

The blend sets the material's mood VALUES; everything downstream still applies on top:

- the **§13 / ADR 0015 palette guard-rail** still bounds the FINAL `col.rgb` (and its `_Palette*` bounds are
  themselves part of the blended set, so a stormier sea gets stormier guard-rail bounds);
- the **ADR 0013 day/night overlay** still MULTIPLIES the whole frame on top.

Both are downstream of the values blended here, so they compose by construction (verified by the disjoint
key-set + the headless tests).

### 14.5 Tunables (rule 6; off = today's exact look)

All on the Sea's `WaterSurface` component (St Peters defaults):

| Tunable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Weather Palette Enabled** | **off** | Master enable. **Off = the Sea reads its `Water.mat` preset exactly (today's look).** |
| **Weather Palette Strength** | 1.0 | 0 = base anchor only (inert / today's look); 1 = the full weather-driven blend. |
| **Base / Calm / Storm / Fog Mood Material** | NA / Glassy / StormGrey / FoggySmother | the four anchor presets the blend mixes. |
| **Sea State Threshold** | 0.15 | sea-state axis (0..1 over Glass..Storm) below which no storm pull. |
| **Sea State Curve** | 1.4 | shaping exponent (1 = linear; >1 = the storm bites LATE — only a real blow goes grey). |
| **Fog Threshold** | 0.25 | fog axis (0..1 over 1−visibility) below which no fog pull (light haze leaves it alone). |
| **Fog Curve** | 1.2 | shaping exponent (>1 = only a thick smother goes pale). |
| **Calm Reach** | 0.8 | how far the lowest sea-state pulls toward the pure CALM preset vs the BASE (0 = base is calm). |
| **Weather Palette Response Time** | 8 s | the ease time constant — how slowly the mood slides between presets (0 = snap). |

To turn it fully off, untick **Weather Palette Enabled** (or set **Strength = 0**) — the Sea is then exactly
its authored preset.

### 14.6 Determinism guard (headless C# twin)

The model is a **pure function** of the deterministic sample + tunables, so it's fully unit-testable headless
(`Assets/Tests/EditMode/Art/WeatherWaterPaletteTests.cs`): the axes normalise/shape monotonically; the weights
always sum to 1 and stay non-negative across the whole weather space; CALM clear water reads serene (no storm,
no fog); a rising sea-state grows the storm mood monotonically; low visibility grows the fog mood monotonically
and **fog dominates** on top of any sea-state (a foggy storm reads mostly fog; a foggy calm reads pale-serene);
a clear gale reads storm-led; `calmReach`/the thresholds behave (calmReach 0 leaves glassy water on the base, a
higher sea threshold delays the storm); the ease is **frame-rate independent** (one step over `dt` == N steps
of `dt/N`); and **STRENGTH 0 / disabled == identity == today's static look** (the base anchor only, at every
weather). The GPU blend of the actual props can't be tested headless, but the WEIGHTS that decide the mood can
— the same precedent as `WaterReflection` / `WaterPaletteGrade` / `DayNightMath`.

## 15. Boat spotlight on the water — the beam lights the sea FROM WITHIN the water shader (ADR 0016)

The boat spotlight (ADR 0016) is an additive glow **quad** that lights **land** at night. It did **not** read on
the **water**: the URP 2D renderer draws the custom-shader water `SpriteRenderer` over the additive `MeshRenderer`
regardless of sorting order / Sort-as-2D / camera-depth pinning (two quad-sort fixes failed). The fix is to light
the water **inside the water's own fragment** — the same idiom the water already uses for the day/night sun
(`_SunDir`), the sky reflection, and the palette grade: read a **published global** and modify `col.rgb`.

- **The beam is published as GLOBAL shader uniforms** by `HiddenHarbours.Art.BoatSpotlight` (on its existing
  throttled tick, ~20 Hz, via `Shader.SetGlobal*` — no per-frame alloc): `_BoatLightPos` (world lamp xy at the
  bow), `_BoatLightDir` (world beam axis = the boat heading `transform.up`), `_BoatLightColor`, `_BoatLightParams`
  (`x` = intensity, `y` = range m, `z` = `cos(halfAngle)`, `w` = `cos(innerAngle)`), `_BoatLightParams2`
  (`x` = radial edge softness, `y/z/w` = night-gate threshold / softness / cycle-off fallback). The half-angle is
  a **cosine** so the water tests the cone with one `dot`, no per-pixel trig. **No boat / off** → intensity 0 →
  the water term is skipped (no stuck beam). **One light** for now (the boat spotlight is THE night-nav light);
  arrays + a count extend it cleanly later.
- **The water frag adds the cone** (`HiddenHarboursWater.shader`, `BoatLightTerm()`, **after** the palette
  guard-rail, pre-compensated for the day/night multiply overlay — the complete-dark fix, §11.6; the rail
  bounds the sea the beam sits on, but no longer clamps/flattens the lit pool): for the pixel's `worldXY`
  (pixel-snapped → the pool reads as **pixel art**) it computes the cone (lamp→pixel within range + within the
  cone, **radial × angular** falloff), scales by the **same night-gate** the land cone uses (off by day, full at
  deep night, off-by-dawn, read from `_DayNightTint`; cycle-off → the tunable fallback), and **ADDs** to
  `col.rgb` divided by `max(_DayNightTint.rgb, 0.02)` so the beam survives complete dark at authored brightness. **Sorting-INDEPENDENT** — it is part of the very draw that was winning the order tie, so it cannot be
  overdrawn like the quad. **`col.rgb` ONLY** — never `depth` / `clip()` / `_WaterLevel` / the height read / the
  sim (the P1-integrity / determinism invariant of every prior addendum holds; the beam is purely cosmetic and
  saves nothing).
- **One beam, two surfaces.** The **same** `BoatSpotlight` tunables (colour / intensity / range / cone / softness)
  drive **both** the land quad and the water term — tuning the spotlight tunes both. A water-side strength
  multiplier (`BoatSpotlight._waterStrength`, default **1.4**) balances how strongly the beam reads on water vs
  land. The effect defaults **ON and strong** so a midnight beam is an obvious raking pool of light on the dark
  sea. **No new material property** → `Water.mat` (and its presets) are untouched.
- **Magenta-safe:** no `+`/operator char in any `[Header]`, no `[unroll]` over a runtime loop, define-before-use
  (the day/night luma is inlined in `BoatLightTerm` since `PaletteLuma` is defined later); the shipped `Water.mat`
  variant is force-compiled by `WaterShaderCompileGuardTests` so a broken term fails CI red, not magenta-in-build.
- **Determinism guard (headless C# twin).** The pure cone/gate maths the water term mirrors live in `LightMath`
  (`CosFromHalfAngleDeg`, `ConeFalloffCos`, `WaterConeTerm`) and are unit-tested in `LightMathTests` (within-cone
  vs behind/outside, range falloff, off-axis dimming, at-the-lamp core, night-gate off-by-day). The GPU term
  itself is verified by the owner at **deep night** driving over open water (the beam is **night-gated**, so it
  fades toward off near dawn — verify ~midnight).

## 16. The shared wave field — whitecaps ride REAL crests (ADR 0018, Arc B1)

The swell layer's next life. §5.8's `SwellField` was **paint** — value-noise brightness bands that existed
only in HLSL, so the whitecap lifecycle (§5.11) gated on noise: the owner's verdict, *"unconvincing… a foggy
white soup."* ADR 0018 replaced the truth: **one deterministic directional wave field** (3–4 wave trains,
`Core/Environment/WaveMath.cs`) that BOTH the boat (B2 rocking, `BoatWaveMotion`) and the water shader sample.
B1 is the shader side: the trains become the water's **primary swell brightness source**, and the whitecaps are
re-keyed to **form → break → streak → fade on real, advancing crests** — foam that visibly **travels with the
wave**, which is what kills the static-soup read.

### 16.1 The bridge (`Art/WaveFieldBridge.cs`) — the same eased sea the hull rides

A self-installing `[RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod]` host (the `GrassWindBridge`/`MoonCycle` pattern). Every
frame it ticks the **same `WaveFieldAnimator`** (ADR 0018 addendum) `BoatWaveMotion` ticks — eased train
parameters chasing the weather-derived `WaveMath.TrainsFrom` targets, dispersion speed re-derived from the
**eased** wavelength (speed is never free), phase accumulated **incrementally in double** and baked into each
train's `PhaseOffset` — then publishes the trains as **global vectors** (outside every CBUFFER; `Water.mat`
untouched):

> `_WaveTrain0..3` — `xy` = unit travel direction, `z` = wave number `k = 2π/λ` (precomputed; the shader never
> divides by a wavelength), `w` = amplitude (m). Dead slots publish zero.
> `_WavePhases` — per-train phase (radians, wrapped to `[0, 2π)` in C# **double** before the float cast).
> `_WaveFieldParams` — `x` = live train count (**0 = nothing published → the LEGACY §5.8 path holds**),
> `y` = crest sharpening p, `z` = total amplitude (the crest normalizer), `w` reserved.

**No time uniform exists**: the shader evaluates `θ = k·(dir·worldPos) + φ` — the advancing time lives entirely
in the phase the animator accumulates, so the unbounded game time never touches float trig on the GPU, and the
water pixels and the hull provably ride the **identical eased sea** (both consumers tick the same animator code
with the same inputs; `WaveFieldBridgeTests` pins the parity). Cycle-off (EditMode / a bare art scene / no sim)
publishes count 0 → the pre-B1 look, the `_DayNightTint`/`_MoonDir` "unset" convention. The bridge's
`WaveFieldSettings`/`WaveFieldAnimatorSettings` start at the same `Default`s `BoatWaveMotion` uses — keep them
identical until a later Arc B PR unifies them on `GameConfig`.

### 16.2 The HLSL twin (`WaveFieldSample()`) and the §(6) transition mapping

A line-by-line transcription of `WaveMath.Sample` (mirrored headless by `WaveFieldBridge.ShaderTwinSample`;
change one, change all **in the same PR**): sharpened sine height, analytic slope, crest factor — plus
`primaryCos`, the primary train's face sign (negative = the wave's front face, the crest is arriving; positive
= behind, it just passed) that drives the foam lifecycle's fore/aft asymmetry. Fixed `[unroll]` bound of 4 with
the live count masked **inside** (never `[unroll]` a runtime count — the #96 trap); pow bases floored at 1e-6
(HLSL `pow(0,0)` NaN guard).

When trains are live, `swellCrest` — the 0..1 crest driver every downstream layer already reads (spec bias
`_SpecSwellBias`, whitecap gate `_FoamCrestGate`, sky-reflection lit faces) — comes from the real field, and
the owner's tuned `_OceanSwell*` values **map on instead of resetting** (ADR 0018 §(6)):

> `_OceanSwellStrength` → the brightness amplitude (`swellSigned × strength × 0.30`). **The brightness now
> reads the SHARPENED crest, not raw height** (owner playtest fix, 2026-07-05): `swellSigned` derives from
> `swellCrest` — `swellSigned = (swellCrest × 2 − 1) × swellLive` — so a **narrow bright ridge sits over a
> broad dark trough (a DEFINED crest)** instead of four summed trains smearing into a wide soft "white
> cloud". Raw un-sharpened height (the old `height/totalAmp`) never reached the eye's brightness; only the
> whitecap gate saw the sharpening. The gain nudged `0.25 → 0.30` because a pinched crest covers less area.
> `swellLive = saturate(_WaveFieldParams.z × 40)` gates the band by the field's un-clamped total amplitude so
> **glass = zero bands = the untouched mirror** stays true even though the remap alone would floor at −1.
> `_OceanSwellSharpness` → the crest-shaping exponent on the 0..1 crest signal (its exact legacy role);
> **default raised 1.4 → 2.2** so the brightness sharpening agrees with the wave field's own crest geometry.
> (The owner's Water.mat override, if any, still wins — his tuned swell dials now read as more DEFINED, so he
> may want to re-tune `_OceanSwellStrength`/`_OceanSwellSharpness`.)
> `_OceanSwellScale` → a **visual wavelength scale**, normalized to the shipped default **0.025**: at 0.025 the
> water renders the field's TRUE wavelengths (pixel == hull); the current tuned 0.07 renders ~2.8× shorter
> waves — retune toward 0.025 when the B2 rocking should visibly match the crests on screen.

**Not carried over** (out of Arc B scope — shore breakers are a later arc, ADR §(5)): the legacy path's
*shoreward crest-bias* — live trains run downwind everywhere; the foam **drift** shoreward bias (§5.12) is
untouched. The legacy `SwellField` path itself stays byte-for-byte behind the count-0 fallback until the owner
signs off the reworked look.

### 16.3 The whitecap rework — form, BREAK, streak, fade (the soup fix)

Open-water caps only (`_Roughness > 0.01` branch); the §5.3 fringe foam is untouched. With live trains the
**lifecycle places the foam on the advancing wave** (`WhitecapLifecycleWave()`, C#-twinned in
`WaveFieldBridgeTests`) and the §5.9 evolving wind-streaked cap field only **textures** it — nothing is a
field-wide veil any more:

- **FORM** — on the wave's **front face** (`primaryCos < 0`) the foam whitens in as the crest builds toward the
  break band.
- **BREAK** — a **tight band at the crest tip**: the `SolidCore` dense heart over the pixelized cap field →
  bright, **crisp pixel-art edges**, not soft alpha fog. `_WhitecapFormSharpness` narrows the band (its legacy
  role); wind lowers it (`− _Roughness × 0.35`, the cap-threshold discipline) so **a gale breaks more crests —
  marching whitecaps**.
- **STREAK** — the residual spreads **downwind** through the existing wind-aniso coord (`_FoamStreakStretch`,
  reused as-is).
- **FADE** — behind the crest (`primaryCos > 0`) the milky remnant decays at `_WhitecapCollapseRate` (its
  legacy role). `_WhitecapPeakDensity` still caps the newborn opacity; `_FoamCrestGate` still dials how tightly
  foam hugs the crest — the same knobs, a truer crest.
- **Sea-state coupling through the trains' amplitudes**: the one new knob, **`_WhitecapOnsetAmp`** (default
  0.5 m) — full caps by that much total train amplitude, first foam from ~10% of it. Glass = zero amplitude =
  **zero foam, automatically** (and the crest factor is already exactly 0 on dead glass — the mirror keeps the
  §11 reflections at full strength).

Composition unchanged: everything is `col.rgb`-only (P1, rule 5 — never depth/`clip()`/`_WaterLevel`/the sim),
sits **below** the palette guard-rail (§13) and **below** the post-grade compensated light block (§11.6 / §15);
the sky reflection's sea-state fade keeps working (it keys off `_Chop`/`_Roughness`, untouched).

### 16.4 Determinism guard (headless C# twins)

`WaveFieldBridgeTests` pins: the **packing layout** (k = 2π/λ, dead slots zero, empty field all-zero); **twin
parity** — `ShaderTwinSample` (the C# mirror of the HLSL) vs the reference `WaveMath.Sample` across the
WaveMathTests sweep, AND through the full runtime path (5 000 uneven animator ticks → `Pack` → reconstruct ==
`animator.Sample`, phases still wrapped — the hull/water same-sea contract); **glass silence**; and the
**lifecycle gates** (forms only on the front face, breaks at the tip, residual dies behind at the collapse
rate, wind widens the breaking population, zero density/troughs = nothing). The shipped `Water.mat` variant is
force-compiled by `WaterShaderCompileGuardTests`, so a broken twin fails CI red, not magenta-in-build.

### 16.5 Swell READ legibility — the passing swell you can SEE (`_SwellReadStrength`)

**Owner playtest (2026-07-08):** working the trap-haul minigame — which times a heave against the passing
swell — the owner reported *"it's hard to see the swells and to know when to time the heave,"* and localized it
to **the water itself**, not the cue: he could not see the wave rise and pass under the boat. The stock
crest/trough brightness (`_OceanSwellStrength × 0.30`) is tuned **subtle** — the shipped `Water.mat` sits at
`_OceanSwellStrength 0.09` × `_OceanSwellSharpness 6`, a swing of only **~±0.027** and a razor-thin pinched
ridge. See must equal feel (P1): the crest the haul samples has to be legible on screen.

The fix is a dedicated, **ON-by-default** legibility knob that amplifies the crest→trough **VALUE contrast** of
the **same shared wave field** (§16) the hull rocks on and the haul times against — value contrast is the
single biggest readability win and works on calm water too. It reads the **BROAD normalized crest**
(`waveHN`, pre-sharpen) rather than the pinched `swellCrest`, so the swell reads as the water **rising/falling**
in a wide moving band instead of a thin line, and adds `readBand × _SwellReadStrength × 0.25` to `col.rgb`
right after the stock swell add. It carries **its own gate, independent of `_OceanSwellStrength`** (so it reads
even where the owner dialed the stock swell down), and **inherits the field's `swellLive` amplitude gate — so
glass stays glass** (a dead-flat sea shows no band; the §11 mirror is untouched).

- `_SwellReadStrength` (default **0.35**) — master contrast amount. `0` = exact passthrough (the pre-feature
  look). At 0.35 the swing is **±0.0875** (~3× the owner's tuned stock swell) — a clearly legible band; the
  §13 palette guard-rail's value floor/ceiling bounds the extremes so troughs never go muddy nor crests blow
  out.
- `_SwellReadBands` (default **0** = smooth) — optional pixel-art posterize of the moving band into N discrete
  value steps for a crisp marching-contour read, mirroring `_DepthBands` / `_SpecBands`.

`col.rgb`-only, additive like every water layer — **never** `depth` / `clip()` / the deep tint / `_WaterLevel` /
the sim wave field (P1 integrity, CLAUDE.md rule 5): the waterline the player wades and the crest the haul
samples are byte-identical, so the sim is provably unchanged. No new C# uniform and no twin — it reads only the
already-sampled `waveHN`; `WaveFieldSample` / `WaveFieldBridge` / `WaveMath` are untouched. Legacy count-0
path (edit mode / cycle off) reuses `swellSigned` so the knob still reads there.

## 17. See-through shallows + day-gated caustics (Arc C water visuals)

Two owner-opt-in shallow-water effects, both shipping **OFF** (their strength = 0), so the shipped `Water.mat`
look is byte-identical until the owner dials them in — exactly like `_ReflectionStrength` / `_SkyReflectionStrength`
(rule 6). They live entirely in `HiddenHarboursWater.shader`, touching **only `col.a` and `col.rgb`** — never
`depth` / `clip()` / `_WaterLevel` / the height read / the sim (P1 integrity, CLAUDE.md rule 5). Both key off the
read-only `depth` (`_WaterLevel - seabedElevation`, metres), so they naturally hug the moving shoreline.

### 17.1 See-through shallows (`col.a` only)

Right at the shore the water goes slightly **translucent** so the **seabed sprite drawn behind the Sea plane**
(lower sorting) bleeds through under the shader's `Blend SrcAlpha OneMinusSrcAlpha`. It runs **after** the depth
block settles the base alpha (the `_USE_DEPTHRAMP` sample *or* the `_ShallowColor`/`_DeepColor` lerp — note the
shipped material has the depth-ramp keyword ON, so the alpha comes from the *ramp texture*, which is fully opaque)
and **before** the shoreline foam re-opacifies `col.a`, so the wet foam edge stays solid:

```hlsl
float shallowT = 1 - saturate(depth / max(_ShallowSeeThroughDepth, 1e-3));   // 1 at the waterline -> 0 deep
col.a *= lerp(1, _ShallowMinAlpha, shallowT * saturate(_ShallowTranslucency));
```

### 17.2 Day-gated caustics (`col.rgb` only)

Folds a **day gate** into the existing shallow caustic add so the sun-dappled light nets only show when the sun
is up. The driver is **`saturate(_SunElevation)`** — 1 at noon, naturally 0 below the horizon at night (this is the
right curve; it is deliberately **not** `SunGlitterGate`, which peaks at *golden hour* and falls to 0 by high sun —
backwards for caustics). When the day/night cycle is **not running** (`_DayNightTint` sum ≈ 0: editor / bare art
scene) it treats the world as **full day**, the same "unset" convention `NightFactor` and the palette grade use —
**not** `_SunElevation == 0`, which is a legitimate value at real sunrise/sunset. An optional `_CausticShallowBias`
pushes the caustic band a little deeper off the very edge (see below).

### 17.3 The interaction (they partly cancel — tune for it)

See-through lowers `col.a` in the **same shallow band** where caustics live in `col.rgb`, and under the SrcAlpha
blend the lowered alpha **fades** the caustic-lit water. So the two effects partly cancel where they overlap.
Mitigations: keep **`_ShallowMinAlpha` conservative** (default `0.65`, and **keep it above 0.5** — the seabed
shows through **ungraded**, so it must read as a *hint of the bottom*, not a hole in the sea); and/or set
`_CausticShallowBias` to bias the dapple a touch deeper so it sits just inside the see-through fringe. The shipped
defaults are tuned so that with both features OFF the look is unchanged.

### 17.4 Tunables (rule 6; all default to today's look)

| Property | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `_ShallowTranslucency` | `0` (**OFF**) | Master for see-through; 0 = `col.a` untouched (today). |
| `_ShallowSeeThroughDepth` | `0.6` m | How far out from the waterline the see-through band reaches. |
| `_ShallowMinAlpha` | `0.65` | Alpha right at the waterline. **Keep > 0.5** — this is the owner's dial for "how much seabed hints through." |
| `_CausticDayGate` | `0` (**OFF**) | 0 = caustics always on (today); 1 = day-only (fades out at night). |
| `_CausticShallowBias` | `0` m | Push the caustic band deeper off the very edge (0 = today's band). |

`_ShallowTranslucency` and `_CausticDayGate` are appended to `WaterSurface.MoodFloatNames`, so the
weather-driven palette (§14) and the preset library (§12) **ease** them per mood — e.g. a `FoggySmother` preset
can kill the sun-dapple and thicken the water so nothing shows through. This is art-lane dressing, not a sim change.

### 17.5 Composition + guard

The alpha multiply is `col.a`-only and the caustic day gate rides the pre-existing `col.rgb` caustic add — both
sit **before** the palette guard-rail grade (§13, `col.rgb`-only) and the post-grade compensated light content
(§11.6), which are left untouched, so they compose cleanly. The shipped `Water.mat` variant is force-compiled by
`WaterShaderCompileGuardTests`, so any HLSL slip fails CI red (not magenta-in-build).

## 18. Current drift lines — the tide's SET reads on the surface (Arc C water visuals)

Faint foam **streaks aligned with the tidal current** so the player can **read which way the sea is setting**
(P1 *The Sea Has Moods*) — the same way real drift lines, foam windrows, and slicks betray a tide rip. It ships
**OFF** (`_DriftLineStrength = 0`), so the shipped `Water.mat` look is byte-identical until the owner dials it in
(rule 6, like `_ReflectionStrength`). It lives entirely in `HiddenHarboursWater.shader` and touches **only
`col.rgb`** — never `depth` / `clip()` / `_WaterLevel` / the height read / the sim (P1 integrity, CLAUDE.md rule 5).

### 18.1 It reads the CURRENT for free (NO new C# uniform)

The lines are built from the **same `_FlowDir` / `_Flow`** the surface scroll already uses. Those are pushed by
`WaterSurface.cs` from **`EnvironmentSample.CurrentVector`** — the tide's **smoothed set** (direction + speed) via
the `CurrentModel`. So the streaks orient with, and drift downstream along, the live current with **no new uniform
push**. This is the same "reuse an already-published uniform" trick the sky reflection (§11.1) uses with the
sea-state — the cheapest correct wiring.

Note the **correction baked into the design**: the aniso streak basis is keyed to **`_FlowDir` (the current)**, not
`_WindDir` (the wind) — the wind drives *roughness / whitecaps* (§5.8), the current drives *where the water is
going*, which is what a drift line shows.

### 18.2 The streak build (`col.rgb` only)

A small HLSL helper `DriftLines(worldXY, dt, t)` added in the **same pre-grade dressing zone the foam + whitecaps
occupy** (after the whitecap block, **before** the palette guard-rail §13), so the guard-rail bounds it like all the
other dressing:

- **Flow-aligned anisotropic basis** — the wind-streak idiom (§5.8), keyed to the current:
  `flowdir = normalize(_FlowDir.xy)`, `flowperp = (-flowdir.y, flowdir.x)`.
- **Advance downstream over time** — `along = dot(pp, flowdir) / _DriftLineStretch − t·_Flow·_DriftLineSpeed`, so
  the streaks **travel with the current**. The along-axis is **stretched** by `_DriftLineStretch` so a round noise
  cell reads as a long thin lane running *with* the flow.
- **Thin ridged-noise lanes across the flow** — the shader's own `pow(saturate(1 − |g1−g2|·k), n)` ridge idiom
  (the same one the caustics/moon glitter use) over two `ValueNoise` samples of the stretched coord → bright thin
  veins = the streaks.
- **Wander** — a slow low-freq `ValueNoise` nudge on the along-coord so the lanes **bend and drift** instead of
  reading as a marching ruler grid.
- **Pixelized** coords throughout (pixel-art faithful, ADR 0010), and the noise is the shader's existing
  `ValueNoise` / `Hash21` + `_Time.y` — **deterministic, no new RNG** (rule 5).
- Tinted faintly toward `_FoamColor` (or the optional `_DriftLineColor`), added — *streaks, not a paint layer*.

### 18.3 The sea-state WINDOW — a BELL, not a fade

The lines **peak on calm-to-moderate water** and are **zero on dead glass** *and* **zero in a storm's chaos**:

- **Zero on dead glass** so the glassy mirror (§11) stays a mirror — a drift line on perfectly still water would
  read as noise, not information.
- **Zero in a storm** because whitecaps + chop (§5.11) already scream the sea-state; drift lines there would just
  add mud to the "foggy white soup" the whitecap rework fought.

So it is a **band over `_Chop`**, not a monotone fade: rises from `_DriftLineSeaStateLo`, holds through the middle,
falls back to 0 by `_DriftLineSeaStateHi` (`rise·fall` of two `smoothstep`s). It **also** eases **down as wind
roughness `_Roughness` rises** (the foam-dodge) so the streaks don't fight the whitecaps, and fades out at the very
**shore** via the read-only depth key `dt` so they live on **open, navigable water**, not the wet foam edge.

> Implementation note: the foam-dodge gates on **`_Roughness`** (a CBUFFER uniform, always in scope), **not** the
> block-local `foamCoverage` (which is computed *inside* the foam branch and is out of scope where the lines are
> added). Simpler and correct.

### 18.4 Tunables (rule 6; all default to today's look)

| Property | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `_DriftLineStrength` | `0` (**OFF**) | Master; 0 = `col.rgb` untouched (today). The owner's main dial. |
| `_DriftLineSpeed` | `0.5` | How fast the streaks drift downstream, as a multiple of `_Flow`. |
| `_DriftLineStretch` | `5` | Along-flow stretch — higher = longer, thinner lanes. |
| `_DriftLineScale` | `0.3` | Lane density (lanes per world unit). |
| `_DriftLineSeaStateLo` | `0.05` | `_Chop` where the lines start rising (below = glass, none). |
| `_DriftLineSeaStateHi` | `0.6` | `_Chop` where the lines are gone (above = storm, none). |
| `_DriftLineColor` | `(…, a=0)` | Optional streak colour; **`a = 0` reuses `_FoamColor`**. |

**How the owner steers it:** raise `_DriftLineStrength` on **calm-to-moderate** water and watch faint streaks trace
the current across the surface — they vanish on dead glass and vanish in a storm. `_DriftLineStretch` /
`_DriftLineScale` tune how ropy vs fine the lines read; `_DriftLineSpeed` how briskly they run with the set.

### 18.5 Composition + guard

`DriftLines` returns an additive `col.rgb` term placed **after** the whitecap block and **before** the palette
guard-rail grade (§13, `col.rgb`-only) and the post-grade compensated light content (§11.6) — the same slot the
foam + whitecaps occupy, so the guard-rail bounds it and it composes cleanly with everything downstream. No
`WaterSurface.cs` change is needed (it reuses `_FlowDir` / `_Flow`). The shipped `Water.mat` variant is
force-compiled by `WaterShaderCompileGuardTests`, so any HLSL slip fails CI **red** (not magenta-in-build).

## 19. Surface rain rings (night-visible) + storm foam lanes (Arc C water visuals — final piece)

The closing Arc C shader pass adds two opt-in `col.rgb`-only dressings that read the live sea mood: **surface
rain rings** (dimple rings where rain strikes the water) and **storm foam lanes** (long downwind foam streaks
that come up in a blow). Both default **OFF** (strength `0` = today's look byte-identical) and, like every
water dressing, never touch depth / `clip()` / `_WaterLevel` / the height read / the sim (P1 integrity, rule 5).
They sit in **opposite** day/night buckets on purpose — see below.

### 19.1 The shared `_RainIntensity` derivation (derived ONCE in C#, never in HLSL)

Rain has no signal in the sim, so its strength is **derived** from two mood axes exactly like the falling-rain
particles (§`RainEmitter`, PR #156): `AmbientParticleMath.RainIntensity(visibility, seaState01, baseline,
seaStateWeight, visOnset, visFull, seaOnset)` — rain is an **occasional squall** that needs BOTH real murk AND
real chop, via **two onsets, not a leaky linear gate**: a **murk gate** (`smoothstep(visOnset, visFull,
visibility)`, `0` while the air is clear at/above `visOnset`, ramping to `1` as visibility falls to `visFull`)
times a **sea-state onset** (`smoothstep(seaOnset, 1, seaState01)`, `0` on near-glass). So a clear or
lightly-choppy night stays **dry** — the fix for the owner playtest where the old `(1-g)+g·fog` gate leaked
~40% of the sea-state drive through even in perfectly clear air (constant rain on any Moderate sea).
`WaterSurface.PushUniforms` computes it **once** (reading the deterministic `EnvironmentSample`) and pushes it
to the cached `_RainIntensity` uniform right next to the `_Chop` push. The shader **never re-derives** rain from
`_Chop`: `_Chop == SeaState01` today but is a distinct retunable knob, so the C# passes `s.SeaState01` directly.
`_RainIntensity` is a **physics-style derived push, NOT a per-mood colour**, so it is deliberately kept **out**
of `MoodFloatNames` (putting it there would double-drive it via the weather-palette blend).

The shape floats are serialized on `WaterSurface` (`_rainBaselineIntensity` `0`, `_rainSeaStateWeight` `1.0`,
`_rainVisOnset` `0.65`, `_rainVisFull` `0.40`, `_rainSeaOnset` `0.30`) with defaults **matching
`RainConfig.Default`** so the surface **rings** and the falling **rain particles** agree out of the box. **If
the owner retunes rain feel, match BOTH** this and `RainEmitter`'s `RainConfig` — a future refactor can unify
them into one shared rain config (flagged, not built here).

### 19.2 Surface rain rings — `RainRings()` (`col.rgb` only; **night-visible, post-grade compensated**)

Expanding concentric **dimple rings** stippled over the water where rain strikes (P1). A pixelized value-noise
grid (`_RainRingScale`) seeds ring **centres**: each cell that passes the `_RainRingDensity` lottery (a stable
per-cell `Hash21`) hosts one raindrop strike, its centre jittered inside the cell and its phase offset per-cell
so the rings do not pulse in lockstep. `RAINRING_TAPS` concentric rings expand from each centre — radius =
`frac(strike phase)` so a ring is born at the centre, grows, and recycles; a thin bright edge (a narrow band
around the growing radius) is the ring line, fading as it expands (a dying ripple). The whole term is gated by
the derived `_RainIntensity` and masked to **open water** via the **read-only** depth key (`dt`) so rings never
stipple the dry shore. The tap count is a **compile-time `#define`** driving a bare `[unroll]` (the `FBM_OCTAVES`
idiom) — **never an `[unroll]` over a runtime count** (the #96 magenta trap).

**OWNER RULING (2026-07-05): the rings must STAY VISIBLE THROUGH THE DARK — a night squall still shows rain on
the water.** So `RainRings()` is added in the **post-grade, overlay-compensated** light block (§11.6), folded
into the same `lightContent` bucket as the boat beam + moon/sun glitter: `float3 lightContent =
BoatLightTerm(...) + skyNightRGB + RainRings(...)`. That bucket is divided by `max(_DayNightTint.rgb,
DN_COMP_MIN_CHANNEL)` when the day/night cycle runs, so the downstream night **MULTIPLY** (ADR 0013) cancels
and the rings read on **black water day AND night**; when the cycle is off (edit mode / bare art / demo) the
same branch adds the content **raw**. This is the deliberate opposite of the storm foam lanes below.

### 19.3 Storm foam lanes — `StormFoamLanes()` (`col.rgb` only; **dims with the night** like the foam)

Long **downwind** foam streaks that come up in a building sea (P1) — the storm sibling of the drift lines (§18),
but keyed to the **wind** (the `_WindDir` aniso basis reused from the whitecaps) not the current, and gated by
`_Roughness` as a **monotone** rise (`blow = _Roughness²`): **gone on calm, strong in a gale** (not a bell).
It reuses the living-whitecap `EvolvingField` + the `pow(saturate(1 - |g1-g2|·k))` ridged-lane streak idiom,
the coord **stretched along the wind** by `_StormFoamLaneStretch` so a round cell reads as a long thin lane,
streamed downwind over time (`t · _Flow`). Depth is read **only** via `dt` (fade at the wet shore edge). Its
locals are named `laneAlong` / `laneAcross` to avoid shadowing the `cross` intrinsic / other helpers' locals.

**Tightened to crisp streaks (owner playtest, 2026-07-05):** the ridge exponent was raised `3.0 → 5.0`
(`pow(saturate(1 − |g1−g2|·2.2), 5.0)` — thinner, more defined veins) and the output multiplier dropped
`0.4 → 0.25`, so the lanes stay **tight streaks even at max `_StormFoamLaneStrength`** instead of blooming
into a broad white wash. `_StormFoamLaneStrength`'s default is unchanged (`0` / off).

`StormFoamLanes()` returns an additive `col.rgb` term placed **pre-grade**, right after the whitecap block and
before the drift-line call — the **same** foam dressing zone the whitecaps occupy — so the palette guard-rail
(§13) bounds it **and** so it **dims with the night** overlay like the rest of the foam. That is the opposite of
the rain rings, which sit post-grade in the compensated bucket to survive the dark.

### 19.4 Tunables (rule 6; all default to today's exact look)

| Property | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `_RainIntensity` | `0.0` | **C#-driven** (derived), not hand-tuned; `0` = no rings. |
| `_RainRingStrength` | `0.0` | Master rain-ring strength; `0` = off / today. |
| `_RainRingScale` | `6.0` | Ring-centre cell scale (**cells/unit — BIGGER = smaller rings**; the label misled: it is cells-per-unit, so a larger value shrinks each ripple). Raised 0.4 → 6.0 (owner playtest, 2026-07-05): at 0.4 one cell was 2.5 world units, so a ripple spanned ~2.5 tiles (a dinner plate); at 6.0 a cell ≈ 0.17 units → fine sub-tile dimples. Pure default change, no math (radius/band are already in cell-units and shrink with the scale). |
| `_RainRingDensity` | `0.35` | Fraction of cells that host a strike. Dropped 1.0 → 0.35 (owner playtest) so drops **scatter sparsely** instead of striking every cell. |
| `_RainRingSpeed` | `1.5` | Ring expansion speed (rings/sec). |
| `_RainRingColor` | pale cool white | Ring line colour. |
| `_StormFoamLaneStrength` | `0.0` | Master storm-lane strength; `0` = off / today. |
| `_StormFoamLaneStretch` | `6.0` | Along-wind stretch (thin lanes). |
| `_StormFoamLaneScale` | `0.3` | Lane scale (lanes/unit). |

Plus the C#-side shape floats on `WaterSurface`: `_rainBaselineIntensity` `0`, `_rainSeaStateWeight` `1.0`,
`_rainVisOnset` `0.65`, `_rainVisFull` `0.40`, `_rainSeaOnset` `0.30` (mirror `RainConfig.Default`).

**How the owner steers it:** raise `_RainRingStrength` **and** `_StormFoamLaneStrength`, then sail into a
building blow. Rain rings dimple the surface and now **read even at night** (per the owner ruling); the storm
lanes streak **downwind** and **dim with the dark** like the foam they belong to. The surface rings and the
falling-rain particles share the one derived `_RainIntensity`, so they thicken together.

### 19.5 Composition + guard

`StormFoamLanes` is `col.rgb`-only, added **pre-grade** with the whitecaps (bounded by the §13 guard-rail).
`RainRings` is `col.rgb`-only, added **post-grade** inside the §11.6 overlay-compensated `lightContent` bucket
(so it survives the night multiply). `WaterSurface.cs` gains the derived `_RainIntensity` push (reusing the
shared `AmbientParticleMath.RainIntensity`); `Water.mat` stays **byte-identical OFF**. The shipped `Water.mat`
variant is force-compiled by `WaterShaderCompileGuardTests`, so any HLSL slip fails CI **red** (not
magenta-in-build).

## 20. Aesthetic pass — clumping foam, deep blues, crest-face shading (owner mandate, 2026-07-08)

> The owner delegated taste (verbatim): *"feel free to tune the water in whatever fashion you think will lead
> to better looking waves, better clumping of foam, deep blues."* This pass builds ON his committed baseline
> (#183 — his own `Water.mat` tuning is the canon this refines, never bulldozes; his locked `_Flow`/`_WindChop`
> stay locked and untouched) and COMPOSES with the #182 swell-read. Three additive levers, one per ask, each a
> named tunable defaulting **ON at a modest strength** (this pass IS the mandate) and each an **exact
> passthrough at 0**. All three are `col.rgb`/`col.a` dressing only — never `depth`/`clip()`/`dt`/
> `_WaterLevel`/the height read/the wave-field sample/the sim (P1 integrity, CLAUDE.md rule 5) — and all three
> sit **pre-grade**, so the §13 palette guard-rail remains the single final colour owner and bounds them like
> every other layer (they are water colour, not light content — they correctly dim with the night overlay;
> the §11.6 post-grade compensated bucket is untouched).

### 20.1 Deep-blue enrichment (the `_USE_DEPTHRAMP` trap, resolved)

The shipped material's base colour comes from the owner's **hand-painted `_DepthRamp`** (`_USE_DEPTHRAMP` ON) —
the `lerp(_ShallowColor, _DeepColor, dt)` path does not run, so `_DeepColor` alone is inert, and repainting his
ramp would bulldoze his art. The lever chosen instead: a **bounded pull of the settled base colour** toward a
rich navy, keyed to the read-only deep fraction `dt`, applied immediately after the base block — **before every
additive layer** (the #182 swell-read, swell bands, spec and foam ride on top at full amplitude; nothing is
washed out) and **before the guard-rail**. `smoothstep(_DeepBlueStart, 1, dt)` leaves the shallows and mid ramp
untouched. The default target `(0.02, 0.09, 0.30)` is the deeper-saturated cousin of the owner's own
`_PaletteDeep` anchor `(0.02, 0.08, 0.26)`, so the grade's anchor pull agrees with it; the enriched deep sits
below his `_PaletteSatCap 0.78` and above his value floor `0.08`, so the rail neither greys it nor lifts it.

| Property | Default (Water.mat) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `_DeepBlueStrength` | `0.45` | Master pull toward the navy; `0` = the painted ramp exactly. |
| `_DeepBlueColor` | `(0.02, 0.09, 0.30)` | The navy target (per-mood: FoggySmother pins strength `0`, StormGrey `0.1`, Water_DeepBlue `0.7`). |
| `_DeepBlueStart` | `0.25` | The `dt` fraction where the pull begins (shallower water untouched). |

### 20.2 Foam clumping — windrows + crest-shed rafts (`_FoamClump*`)

The open-water whitecaps read as an **even sprinkle** — organic per-fleck (§5.9) but statistically uniform.
Real foam **gathers**: wind rows (lanes of foam down the wind) and rafts shed by breaking crests, with bare
water between. A second, much **broader and slower** `EvolvingField` (reused helper; pixel-snapped; evolving at
0.35× the foam boil rate — rafts morph slower than the flecks riding them), **stretched along the wind** like
the caps and sampled on the same drifted coord, **REDISTRIBUTES** the cap coverage: a soft patch mask
(`smoothstep(0.35, 0.65, field)` around the field's midline) lifts in-patch coverage ×1.25 (saturated) and
thins between-patch coverage toward bare water. The same foam, gathered instead of thinned. Applied to **both**
whitecap paths (trains-live and legacy) via one gate on `capOpacity`; the §5.3 shoreline fringe is deliberately
untouched (the sprinkle complaint is the open water; the fringe already has the swash/churn character).

| Property | Default (Water.mat) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `_FoamClumpStrength` | `0.55` | Master gathering; `0` = today's even sprinkle. |
| `_FoamClumpScale` | `0.10` | Patch frequency (patches/unit) — smaller = broader rafts, wider clear lanes. |
| `_FoamClumpStretch` | `2.5` | Wind anisotropy — `1` = round rafts, higher = long thin windrows. |

### 20.3 Swell face shading — the modelled wave (`_SwellFaceShade`)

`WaveFieldSample()` already computes the field's **analytic slope** (`waveSlope`) for twin parity — previously
unused in the composite. This shades each swell face against the **one implied sun** (`_SunDir`, falling back
to `_LightDir` — the ADR 0006 single-light discipline, the specular's exact fallback): the surface normal's
ground component is minus the height gradient, so `-dot(waveSlope, lightDir)` is positive on the **lit face**
and negative behind the crest. Where the #182 swell-read is **symmetric** (crest bright / trough dark), this is
**antisymmetric** (lit face vs shaded back) — they compose into a directional, modelled wave instead of
doubling one band into glare (combined worst-case crest add ≈ 0.16 pre-grade, inside the rail's ceiling). The
×2 slope normalizer and the 0.15 add ceiling follow the swell-read's documented-constant idiom (at the 0.22
default the swing is ±0.033 — shading, not glare). **Self-gating:** glass publishes zero amplitude ⇒ zero slope
⇒ zero term (the §11 mirror is untouched); the legacy count-0 path leaves `waveSlope` at 0 (pre-B1 look
unchanged there). No new uniform and **no C# twin needed** — it consumes `WaveFieldSample`'s existing outputs
(the #182 precedent); `WaveMath`/`ShaderTwinSample` are untouched.

| Property | Default (Water.mat) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `_SwellFaceShade` | `0.22` | Lit-face/shaded-back contrast; `0` = flat bands (FoggySmother pins `0` — flat fog light). |

### 20.4 Composition, registration + guard

Perf (rule 7): +1 `EvolvingField` (4 value-noise taps) per **whitecap-branch** pixel when clumping is on, one
`smoothstep` chain for the deep pull, one dot/clamp for the face shade — no new texture fetches. The new float
keys join `WaterSurface.MoodFloatNames` (+ `_DeepBlueColor` in `MoodColorNames`) so the §12 preset library and
the §14 weather blend ease them per mood — look props only, disjoint from the physics set (no double-drive).
`Water.mat` serializes the new keys explicitly at their defaults (and pins the previously-unserialized
`_SwellReadStrength 0.35` / `_SwellReadBands 0`); the owner's tuned values are otherwise byte-identical. The
shipped `Water.mat` + every `WaterPresets/` variant stay force-compiled by `WaterShaderCompileGuardTests`
(no `+` in any `[Header]`, no `[unroll]` over a runtime bound — the magenta class stays guarded).

## 21. The shore seam — displacement dies at the walkable waterline (ADR 0023, displaced-water arc step 1)

The displaced-water arc (owner greenlit 2026-07-22; decision + full derivation in
`docs/adr/0023-displaced-water-surface.md`) will lift the water as a real mesh surface — the same
deterministic field, vertically displaced through the ADR 0022 off-screen pattern. Before any surface ships,
the arc's step 1 solves and proves its one hard problem: **displacement must reach exactly zero at the
walkable waterline or the coast tears** (water drawn over dry sand at a crest; a bared strip at a trough).

**The mechanism — `Core.ShoreFadeMath` (pure, additive):**

```
fade = smoothstep(0, band, depth)        depth = WaterLevelAt(t) − ElevationAt(pos)
lift = waveHeight × exaggeration × fade  (ShoreFadeMath.DisplacedHeight — EVERY consumer reads this)
```

The fade's zero set is the depth-0 iso-contour of the painted seabed **itself** — the same
`WaterLevelAt − ElevationAt` read the water shader, walkability and boat-cross already share (the one
height map gains its **fourth consumer**). As the tide moves the waterline, the seam moves with it; there is
no second contour to drift. The falloff band is **derived, not tuned** (rule 6):
`band = 2 × envelope × exaggeration × shoreGradient` (`RecommendedBandMeters` — overlap bound 1.125,
in-band fold bound 1.5, coefficient 2 holds both with margin), giving a steepness-independent ground
footprint of `2 × envelope × exaggeration` ≈ 3.1 m of shallows at the reference sea × 1.5.

**Proof shipped with step 1** (the numbers live in ADR 0023 and
`Assets/_Project/Code/Tools/Editor/ShoreSeamProof/Evidence~/proof-log.txt`):

- `ShoreFadeMathTests` (headless, CI-safe): displacement exactly 0 on the contour at three tides; shore
  transects over four profiles × three tides never cross the waterline and never fold — including the
  100%-envelope event (t = 1513.5 s, pinned as a regression guard) parked adversarially at mid-band; past
  the band the seam is bit-invisible.
- The `ShoreSeamProof` editor harness (GPU, evidence committed): rendered water/land boundary vs the
  analytic contour = **0 px** deviation on every north shore at every tide (±1 px south, sub-pixel
  rasterization); the seam-OFF control tears 31 px / gaps 50 px; open-sea render at the event moment is
  pixel-identical with the seam active (0 of 518,400).

**Contracts binding on the later phases** (the production surface, hull heave, glitter/whitecap retunes —
ADR 0023 §Phases): one sea (displace the existing field only), ONE shared exaggeration constant read through
`DisplacedHeight` by surface and hulls alike, the style law (solid bands, dithered edges, world-locked
cells, owner palette anchors), and the HLSL twin discipline — the production vertex shader's fade must be a
line-for-line twin of `Fade01`, changed only in lockstep.


## 22. The displaced surface in production — the water joins the off-screen pass (ADR 0023, arc step 2·1)

Step 1 of phase 2 puts the displaced surface IN the game, behind a dev A/B toggle (the owner's
readability verdict instrument). The wiring, for anyone touching it:

- **Two passes, one program.** `HiddenHarboursWater.shader` now holds its whole program in a
  SubShader-scope `HLSLINCLUDE`; the flat `Universal2D` pass and the new off-screen
  `HHWaterDisplaced` pass (LightMode `HHWater`) share every declaration, helper and the FULL
  fragment — the displaced sea cannot drift from the flat sea because it IS the flat sea's
  fragment on lifted geometry. The A side of the A/B is byte-identical to today: same pass, same
  vertex, same pragmas.
- **The vertex twin.** `vertDisplaced` lifts each vertex by
  `height × _WaveExaggeration × ShoreFade01(stillDepth, _ShoreFadeBand)` — the same
  `WaveFieldSample` the fragment paints with (one field, two sampling densities, same visual
  frequency scale), the same painted-seabed depth read (`SeabedElevationLod` — the LOD-0 vertex
  twin of `SeabedElevation`; the height map has no mips, so the reads are byte-identical), and the
  line-for-line HLSL twin of `Core.ShoreFadeMath.Fade01` (§21). The fragment receives the
  UNDISPLACED ground position, so `clip()`, bands, foam and every layer are painted at the ground
  coordinate and ride the lift — the walkable waterline and clip contour are untouched by
  construction.
- **The ADR 0022 route, with one refinement.** The displaced mesh joins `IsoFacetHullFeature`'s
  off-screen recording and shares the facet passes' PRIVATE depth buffer (never the scene depth —
  a depth-writing mesh there punches holes in every later sprite). It writes its OWN colour target
  (`_HHWaterScreenTex`, ARGBHalf so the night light content's pre-compensated >1 values survive;
  alpha = the water's own translucency), NOT a fifth MRT attachment: the facet buffers' alpha is
  the hull-id contract, and water pixels inside them would starve the keyline flood of the empty
  neighbours it floods into. The keyline resolve is byte-identical with or without water; the
  shared z-buffer is the part phase 3's waterline-on-the-hull needs. Membership in the off-screen
  renderer list is an EXPLICIT rendering-layer bit (`DisplacedWaterRegistry.RenderingLayer`), so
  the flat Sea sprite and the owner's preset materials — which carry the same shader — can never
  ride into the pass by accident.
- **The in-scene face** is `WaterOverlay` (`HiddenHarboursWaterOverlay.shader` + the committed
  `WaterOverlay.mat`): a quad sampling `_HHWaterScreenTex` at its own SV_Position, sorted through
  a SortingGroup at the flat sprite's exact layer/order — boats, characters and props stack
  against the displaced sea exactly as against the flat one.
- **Plumbing** (`DisplacedWaterSurface`, beside `WaterSurface` on the Sea): chunked vertex grid
  (default one vertex per 8 px — the ADR perf envelope; chunk math pinned by
  `DisplacedWaterMathTests`), the flat renderer's MaterialPropertyBlock copied each throttled tick
  (one sea, two representations), the displaced material a runtime instance of the LIVE Water.mat
  with the `Universal2D` pass disabled, and the fade band DERIVED each tick:
  `band = coefficient × live envelope × exaggeration × shoreGradient`
  (`DisplacedWaterMath.BandMeters`, pinned bit-equal to `ShoreFadeMath.RecommendedBandMeters`).
  Exaggeration (×1.5) and coefficient (2) are inspector parameters for now; GameConfig exposure is
  arc step 3.
- **The A/B**: `O` at runtime (rebindable, the DevBoatPicker pattern) flips flat ↔ displaced in
  place. OFF is a contract: nothing registers, the feature records nothing, the flat water renders
  exactly as today.

Still ahead in the arc (ADR 0023 §Phases): the envelope-relative band/whitecap retune on the
displaced fragment (step 2), GameConfig exposure (step 3), hull waterline + shared heave
(phase 3), and the screen-anchored-layer reviews (phase 4).
