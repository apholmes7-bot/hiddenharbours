# Imported art — "Hidden Harbours Assets" sheet

> Final pixel-art for the Coddle Cove vertical slice, imported from the Claude Design project
> *Hidden Harbours Assets* (`f9a59e08-…`). The sheet is authored to our exact standard —
> **32 px = 1 m · no anti-aliasing · transparent PNG** — so it drops straight into the VS-23 lock.
> On first import, `Editor/ArtImportPipeline.cs` stamps PPU 32 · Point · Uncompressed · mips off ·
> pivots automatically; Unity generates the `.meta` files then (commit those after opening the project).

## What landed

| Sprite | File | px (W×H) | At PPU 32 | Wrap / pivot | In-game use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dory hull | `Boats/Dory.png` | 64×144 | 2 m × **4.5 m** (bow-up) | Clamp · centre | The Dory (T0) hull — `VS-26` |
| Sea tile | `Tilesets/Water/SeaTile.png` | 64×64 | 2 m × 2 m, **seamless** | **Repeat** · centre | tiling water surface — `VS-24` |
| Fisher | `Characters/FisherSheet.png` | 96×256 | sheet of 32×64 cells | Clamp · feet | player/NPC sprite — `VS-25` |
| Cod | `Sprites/Fish/Cod.png` | 48×32 | 1.5 m × 1 m | Clamp · centre | catch icon — `VS-26` |
| Haddock | `Sprites/Fish/Haddock.png` | 48×32 | — | Clamp · centre | catch icon |
| Mackerel | `Sprites/Fish/Mackerel.png` | 48×32 | — | Clamp · centre | catch icon |
| Lobster | `Sprites/Fish/Lobster.png` | 48×32 | — | Clamp · centre | catch icon |

The sea tile lives under `Tilesets/Water/` so the import lock sets **Repeat** wrap (it's seamless);
everything else is Clamp. The dory's 144 px length is the canon 4.5 m — true metric scale holds.

## Fisher sheet — slicing spec (for whoever wires the player animation)

`FisherSheet.png` is a **3 × 4 grid of 32 × 64 cells** (Sprite Mode: **Multiple**, Grid By Cell Size
**32 × 64**). The design's own viewer defines the layout:

- **Rows = facing:** row 0 = **Down** (toward camera), row 1 = **Up**, row 2 = **Left**, row 3 = **Right**.
- **Columns = frames:** col 0 = idle/neutral, cols 1 & 2 = the two walk frames.
- **Walk cycle:** `[1, 0, 2, 0]` at ~230 ms/frame (step-left → neutral → step-right → neutral).

This matches the bible §3.4 four-facing character convention (right is its own art here, not mirrored).
Slice it in the Sprite Editor (or a follow-up Art tool) before building the Animator/Sprite Library.

## Next steps to make it visible in-game (cross-lane — not done here)

These need Unity to resolve the imported sprite references, and several sit in other lanes:
- **Greybox swap:** point the Dory's `SpriteRenderer` at `Boats/Dory.png` and the water at the sea
  tile instead of the colour blocks (the placeholder→final swap). *(art-pipeline / app)*
- **Fish data:** assign each `Sprites/Fish/*.png` to the matching `FishSpeciesDef` sprite ref. *(economy-sim / world-content)*
- **Player sprite:** slice `FisherSheet.png` and build the 4-direction Animator. *(gameplay-systems / world-content)*
